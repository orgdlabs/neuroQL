I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better.

The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category).

Highs are crisp and clear.When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.  I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny.\",\n",

The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.  I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny.\",\n",

       "   '?review_text': 'To anyone who hasn\\'t tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they\\'re good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they\\'re very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I\\'d rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we\\'re talking about value, they\\'re a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you\\'re trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there\\'s really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.',\n",

Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.
