The work great with my Android phone and can be \"rolled up\" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched.  They are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day.  The sound is night and day better than any ear-bud could be and are almost as good as the Pro 4AA.  They are \"open air\" headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types, but it comes close. For $32, you cannot go wrong."}, {"review_id": "ce76793f036494eabe07b33a9a67288a", "review": "To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection."}, {"review_id": "d040f2713caa2aff0ce95affb40e12c2", "review": "I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there."}], "B00001WRSJ": [{"review_id": "043e7162df91f6ea916c790c8a6f6b22", "review": "My sister's Bose headphones finally died and so, her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the high-end stuff, i gave her my JVC HA-RX700 and she loves them even more than the Bose. So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly \"bother\" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can't imagine headphones getting that much better. i've heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me."}, {"review_id": "29ccd7e690050e2951be49289e915382", "review": "Wow. Just wow. I'm a 22 yr old with a crazy obsession with sound and music. Audiophile? Maybe. These headphones are so perfect in every way. The sound is so crisp, clear and clean, the design is awesome and simple and the materials are very high quality. They are so comfortable even for my sensitive ears. The bass is just absolutely perfect, not choppy or muddy at all. Forget the Beats, forget the Souls by Ludacris, save yourself the money and get higher quality at half the price. There's no surprise that these have been so widely used for almost 30 years. The included adapter is perfect because it allows me to use these cans in my iPhone and home audio system which is also 100% Sony, I just love their audio hardware."}, {"review_id": "deb36e2a474c0eb4b67356d8c423435b", "review": "Hello, This is my first review for the Sony MDR-V6 with CCAW Voice Coil.SoundFirst I would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing. I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100."}, {"review_id": "456b1ca6c68d516da88d50f7b5451d39", "review": "First pair I bought got stolen outta my car, somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :(Anyway, first pair sounded great.I bought another pair, there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency.

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface."}], "B00004SABB": [{"review_id": "acc40990720aba8c38ecc7cda49b4d94", "review": "the view is so good and clear and so easy to focus in and light not heavy must get you a pair"}], "B00004SB92": [{"review_id": "7a07233797dab7f67f9cb62598e41924", "review": "Ibought this router for my wireless setup at home.

I work from home and run a variety of network intensive tasks, throw in a wife and a Wii and this router has taken care of everything with only a minor quirk or two all year.At home my network consists of CentOS 5.2 servers, a Windows Vista Home Premium Desktop, two Vista laptops (Business and Home Premium), a MacBook, a Windows XP machine, and Virtual Machines up the wazoo.  The 4 ports are full, everything else is run through the wifi including the new Wii.

The instructions were clear and would allow an absolute idiot to set this up although I didn't need them being familiar with their other routers.I live in a largish apartment, and rather than being in a central location the router is squirreled away in the corner office on top of a desktop and below my TV - not ideal I know but the coverage throughout the apartment is always at maximum strength, is as fast as can be expected and I am happy.  I often play online games in my living room on the opposing side of the apartment without problems of laggyness.I first turned on the router in July 2007.  It is now November 2008 and it has been reset maybe four or five times during that period.  Wi-Fi services disappeared forcing me to power off and on again however considering that this is a router based on home usage rather than a fully fledged commercial enterprise I can handle that.

I was expecting good things from them for a computer speaker system but was blown away by the ProMedia 2.1s. Highs and mids are crystal clear and BIG. Bass booms, a little more than I am use to, so I backed the sub off a little until it was what I wanted. These speakers are more than I expected am am more than satisfied with their performance thus far. These are high quality speakers both in sound output and construction."}, {"review_id": "2f05da2ec23c59dfa4c25f5a12819198", "review": "Let me preface my review by saying that I am no \"audiophile.\"  While I do have electrical engineering knowledge and understand many of the specs that can be compared amongst speaker sets, I cannot discern some of the subtle differences that true audio technicians can.  On the other hand, I am also picky about sound quality and am able to immediately notice many aspects of speaker design based on how they affect the sound of a song.With that said, my appraisal of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is a 5-star rating.  These high-quality speakers are excellently designed, admirably built, and deliver outstanding sound quality whether they are used with music, movies, or video games.First off, the speakers themselves are wonderful.  Featuring strong midrange drivers and bright \"horn style\" tweeters (a Klipsch tradition), they deliver the full range of frequencies contained in a typical audio track.  In this regard they surpass competition such as Logitech, which lacks good midrange abilities.  The Klipsch speakers are good enough to draw out flaws in lower quality audio tracks, which can be mildly annoying, but is a great testimony to the quality of the drivers and filters.Now, the subwoofer.  I demand GOOD bass from my music.  I hate deafeningly loud, boomy bass units that obscure the higher frequencies and irritate everyone within a half mile radius.  On the other hand, weak bass drivers that rattle and vibrate or distort when the music is turned up are also an abomination.  The Klipsch subwoofer, which runs at 50 watts continuously and can peak at 130 watts, is perfect for in-home audio use.  While it probably would not be sufficient to overcome road noise in a car (I have a 150 watt subwoofer there), it is more than ample for a home theater system.  I absolutely love the sound of the bass from this thing; while it is ported, which generally makes for boomier bass, the Klipsch unit does deliver very tight, clean bass.  A former roommate who was arguably much more of an \"audiophile\" than myself even commented with approving surprise about the great resonance the sub has at low frequencies.  Again, this sub might appear to be weak at only 50 watts RMS, but it is MORE than sufficient.  If you turn up the volume loud enough to start distorting or rattling the subwoofer, you will be completely deafened by the satellites.Features are where the Klipsch speakers lose a few points from the overall rating...but not very many.  Like most computer speakers, they feature a decently lengthy input cord (1/8\" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack), headphone port, and volume adjustment on the primary satellite.In addition, three features stand out as especially nice.  First, there is an additional input port (female 1/8\" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack) which means you can play music and video games at the same time, for example.Next, the speakers are connected to the amplifier/subwoofer unit via detachable 2-wire speaker cords, NOT hardwired cords.  This means you have a lot of flexibility in the placement of the units; additionally, the included wires are very long.  If they aren't long enough, you could also solder an extra length of ordinary speaker wire to the amplifier end because they simply clip into place.  The satellite ends have 1/8\" jacks on them which plug firmly into the back of the satellites.Lastly, the subwoofer can be fully adjusted via a knob on the primary satellite, meaning you can turn it down or even off without affecting the volume of the music.  This is great in apartments and dorms where the bass is OK during the day but must be toned down at night to avoid disturbing people.The one feature of the set that is NOT a plus would be the placement of the power switch.  In order to prevent that awful popping noise that occurs when you power up a speaker set remotely (such as by flipping the switch on a power strip), you'll want to use the unit's built-in power switch.  Unfortunately, this is located on the back lower part of the amplifier/subwoofer, under the wiring connections and generally in a place where you will have trouble reaching.  Usually, the sub gets tucked away under a desk or in a corner, and thus the switch location is rather terrible.  Logitech systems, for example, often have a remote or hardwired control pod which includes power and volume controls.Build quality on the speakers is also a plus.  The subwoofer is sturdy and rugged MDF, with a quality black coating and a firmly attached rear amplifier panel.  The satellites are injection molded plastic, but it is thick and strong, and the bases (which can be removed for optional wall mounting) are coated metal.  I have had the speakers for several years now and they have never once acted up on me or required repair.All in all, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 set is a phenomenal, spectacular set of speakers for a relatively cheap, 2.1 style unit that was designed with computer audio in mind.  With a few adapters, you can easily use this with your TV, XBox, and many other devices, as I currently do.  Again, larger home audio units will provide better and louder sound, but these will also cost a great deal more.  I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone who needs a compact setup but demands good quality sound."}], "B000065BP9": [{"review_id": "1c733fd993be13720df7b9566bd71fcc", "review": "After returning a more expensive but terrible set of headphones (ULTRASONE iCans-Okta S-Logic Surround Sound Portable Headphones) which were extremely uncomfortable and had a too-short cord, I bought the Sennheiser HD 202 which are perfect for my purpose.I bought these very recently to use with a boombox to listen (while sitting or lying down)to Hemi-Sync and other binaural beat CDs and tapes which produce alpha, theta, and delta states for meditation and exploration.

It is a nice green glow that looks good, but not so bright to be annoying.CONCLUSION:  I like the color of the D-link hub, as it pretty much matches my SMC Baracade router. Having 7-ports in a USB hub is just an awesome thing, I love how fast the transfer rate is, and I love the green glowing port LED's. With it being self-powered, I no longer have to leave my computer on to charge a USB device.

I've been using this specific brand of headphones for about 12 years now, and I refuse to buy another brand or style.It started about 25 years ago, when I was living with my parents, and I had a pair of headphones that I absolutely LOVED! About 10 or so years ago, I wanted to try and find another pair just like them, so I went searching.I finally realized that the pair I used when I was younger were called Porta-Pro, also made by Koss. However, those are a little more expensive and I didn't really like the way they felt on my head. Maybe it's my big head, but they just felt too tight. So, somebody recommended these, and I just fell in love with them.The are very comfortable - even for my big head. It's almost like you're not even wearing headphones. I like the design, and the soft, blue material on top is comfortable resting on your head. Also, the volume control is very convenient. I always use it as opposed to the volume on my MP3 player or computer now.The only negative is that - since they are so inexpensive - they are made of cheaper materials, and my two boys (ages 9 and 11) have torn up a few. Usually, the jack gets shorted out and one, or both, of the speakers stop working. This could easily be fixed with some solder and an iron, but since they're so cheap, I usually just buy another pair. Also, the pads tend to wear down over time, but that's to be expected. You can purchase an extra set of pads as a backup, which I did.As for the sound? It's great. There is a lot of bass response in the phones, and the volume can get pretty loud. The sound is also very clear, and I would compare the audio quality to $100 headphones I've owned in the past.I highly recommend the KTX-Pro1 headphones by Koss. These are hands down the best value for a headphone under $20. Trust me, you won't go wrong with these cans."}], "B00007E7C8": [{"review_id": "beb86b4aac7d896cf638f38f41434780", "review": "These headphones were too big for my head, I have to  tilt them at an odd angle to sit them on my head.

Having a prime lens (one that does not zoom in or out) forces you as the photographer to be the zoom and to move your body to the best possible position for the shot.  This makes you think so much more about your positioning during your shot and forces you to actually move around which is a huge positive.  Also, having a lens that has an aperture as wide open as 1.8 forces you to actually learn about aperture and when it is a good idea to shoot with it wide open at 1.8 and when it is a better idea to use a smaller aperture.  At first you'll be very tempted to shoot with it wide open, but I have found I more often shoot with this lens at 2.8 because the depth of field is more usable otherwise it's too easy to let's say have one eye in focus while the other eye is out of focus.Like many others I use this on a canon T3i with a 1.6 crop sensor which means this lens will actually be 80mm.  This makes it a very ideal lens for portrait photography but it can be a little tight for let's say street photography.  If the focal length is a little long I would suggest going with an 35mm prime instead.  This lens doesn't have as nice of a build quality as some of the more expensive canon lenses but the price is unbeatable and the image quality is unbelievable at this price point.  This is the lens that is on my camera 95% of the time and I recommend it to all of my photographer friends.

I dispute claims that it's noisy, as it sounds quite silent next to the sound of my 20D's shutter.Unfortunately it feels like it came out of a cereal box. The lack of a metal mount makes me wonder. And I worry that my lens doesn't say \"MADE IN JAPAN\". Still, the day I got it it fell off my printer onto the floor, about a four foot drop, which it survived entirely without a scratch... we'll see how that goes. One major ergonomic disadvantage, apart from the fact that in your hands the lens feels like something that came out of the cereal box, is the fact that the focusing ring is, like, right at the end of the lens, and is easily turned while holding the lens.

It's light, which is nice, but, honestly, this thing feels like a Tupperware container. The focus ring, especially, because it shakes around, it's tiny, and it just feels like dry plastic against dry plastic. Autofocus isn't any better. It's loud and obnoxious. It's pretty fast and accurate, but it's not pleasant, being jerky and stiff. After using it for a while, I stop noticing it, but when you're thinking about it, it's terrible.There are definitely better 50mm's that you could buy, but I couldn't believe the photo quality that I got for $100.

Now to those who say one cannot compare a prime to a zoom, I say: why not? Aren't we discussing image quality or are we discussing something else?Given the very large images produced by modern DSLRs, I can crop the image from this 50mm and get the zoom effect I need given the minimum zoom of 50mm (times crop factor). I can also place this lens on my Elan 7 film camera and get spectacular results. I use this lens more and more and zoom using my physical zoom (feet) and digital zoom (Photoshop or Aperture or any image editing software). The results are always great. No, I cannot print to 40x60 inches if I crop from this lens, but I am not planning to do that anyway.When I shoot a wedding (not bridal portraits, I use the 85mm prime for that) the photos made using this lens are always the best and always the favorites. I know it does not have the little red ring around it but that is just to show other photographers that you are hip and with it, not necessarily to get better images and certainly not based on the money-to-image-quality ratio. Nope, buying a more expensive camera or a more expensive lens will NOT make you a better photographer. Using a prime lens, however, like this very affordable option, will certainly improve your images.The cons are obvious: low build quality. This means that the lens is likely to last for only ten years or so, judging by the fact that other Canon primes (and all Canon lenses in general) are notoriously and incredibly reliable (the more expensive f/1.4 version of this lens a notable exception, but still very, very, very reliable).The sum of all my comments is but this: for the money, there is no finer nor more useful lens for your Canon EOS Camera."}, {"review_id": "0342b205aa972dc0e804f9c5cbf69988", "review": "My daughter's friend is a professional photographer doing weddings, portraits, etc and when she got started she told a friend she was going to have to get a better camera that the photos weren't as good as she thought she should get.

Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much.

They are relatively inexpensive and have a beautiful warm, boomy sound that was absolutely shocking when I first put them on. They are the best sounding headphones I have that I can wear comfortably.These headphones have very similar sound quality to the HD280s but tend to make music more enjoyable. While the 280s are more analytical and balanced, the px 100s are more colorful and have more bass. They also do not highlight the highs so much that poor quality audio files are impossible to listen to. These headphones have half the impedance of the 280s which means you are getting richer sound in a more portable package for half the cost- with increased battery life on portables.SE110s are slightly clearer and allow individual instrumentation to be heard better, but their sound quality does not create a balance (favoring the highs) that makes music enjoyable. They are also not comfortable. Both are good for classical music but I think the PX 100s are better because of their warm sound and deep lows, which really brings crescendos to a climactic finish where SE110s always leave the listener feeling cheated out of the final hit.These have the same depth of bass response as the Sony 71s, but are more clear and are not as muddy in the mids and highs.They are about as clear in the highs as apple ear buds (they are better than most people want to think) but also allow for clear bass and do not sound tinny and like someone pushed the right side of an equalizer to max.The Ink'd ear buds are the closest in terms of overall sound to these and cost only a third of what the the PX 100s cost, but are less comfortable, do not stay in your ear, translate the sound of the cord, and only sometimes sound right (you have to have a perfect fit, which is nigh impossible)These are my favorite pair and I only put them away when I *must* be isolated from my environment.

I just went out and shot for 5 hours with this, my 18-105mm lens attached to my Nikon D90 and I got some nice shots with it. The main reason I needed a tripod in the first place is to be able to shot in bulb mode with my wireless remote and this tripod was just that and you can't beat the price. I would also recommend getting the AmazonBasics wireless remote, it works exactly the same as the Nikon brand one. I will also attach a photo I took with this tripod to let you see how well it works.

I am simply making a value judgement based on the price I paid -- about $35.00.I've had the pack for about two weeks now, and have loaded it up with a bunch of stuff, including two digital bodies, three zoom lenses, a Speedlite flash, a pocket tri-pod, a flash diffuser and an extra lense bag.  All of that is inside the main compartment. I am very pleased with how the main compartment can be sub-divided to fit just about any camera attachments you might have. Padding all around is quite adequate, although a bit more could be used at the top of the bag where the camera body and lense typically sit.The two zippered mesh compartments inside the main flap hold quite a bit of stuff, including the camera manual, flash manual, and various extra flash cards and batteries.The two velcroed pockets on either side of the bag are not designed to protect, but to hold stuff. That's fine with me, so I don't put anything in them that I mind getting wet or dusty.The main compartment flap has two zippered pockets on the outside. The bigger of the two pockets unzips on both sides and the top, and reveals two more small pockets and a small snap-hook. I use this pocket to store a photographic magazine or two I'm reading, cables, etc.The other zippered pocket on the main flap zips across the top and is wide and deep enough to hold quite a bit more stuff, stuff that is flat or can be flattened.The very outside of the main flap also has an open, expandable stretch-cord pocket that can be used to stuff in a light windbreaker.My impression is that this bag has so many pockets and compartments that you could overload it if you are not careful. Before using this bag, I had cameras and accessories in three different \"regular\" camera bags. Now it's all in one place, and I would not consider going back to a regular camera bag -- even if I do have to set the pack down before opening it up to retrieve cameras and accessories.Regarding quality of material and work, I am quite pleased. No frayed straps, no broken buckles, no weak seams, no shoddy workmanship.So the question is, for $35.00 did I get a good camera backpack? My answer without hesitation is, \"Yes.\" Does this pack have the same quality and features of a $65.00 or $100.00 pack. No, of course not.BOTTOM LINEFor $35.00 my expectations were exceeded by this bag.

If you are 36&#34; tall and weigh 50 - 80 pounds this bag will work nice. If you own a DSLR with telephoto lenses you are probably not in the 1st grade.

This is a great option that really makes it versatile for all types of lenses.I can fit about 5 lenses and a camera body in this case.The case seems to be fairly water resistant, but I would not feel too confident in a heavy downpour! There is a flap that covers the zipper all the way around and this would act as a line of defense between the inside and the rain.This case also has a tripod strap that allows you to strap a tripod onto the backpack, I do not have a great tripod, but when I used this with my tripod it worked fine for the most part. The only issue I had was that it did not hold the tripod in position, it seemed to slip out more to one side or the other while walking at extended distances. To be fair I might have just not had it strapped in tight enough.Overall a great case for ANY SLR camera, I have since switched from Canon to Nikon and as you would expect the case works great.

Final conclusion was: No, it is not worth it for me. But it might be for you. Here's why and how I came to my conclusion. I have also included some photos I took with the 7D and the 1.4 lens.I have been able to work with the 1.2 before, and was ready to buy my own. Buying the 1.2 was quite a leap, but I knew it would do the job. I researched the 1.4 hoping it could be just as good but for a lot less. What helped me come to my final decision to purchase the 1.4 was a website by Jim Arnold - [...] It has examples of the same shots using both lenses! I was worried that I would want the 0.2 difference in the lens, and I would miss it with the 1.4. But I must say that is not the case at all! This site has a ton of examples using the different lenses. He includes photos taken at f1.2, f1.4, and f2.8Bokeh on the 1.4 - One of the photos I added shows the bokeh of the 1.4. The 1.4 has 8, the 1.8 has 5. The 1.2 has also has 8 blades but produces a little bit smoother bokeh. But when I tested the bokeh on the 1.4 I was not disappointed. The difference was not all that obvious.Why not the f1.8 lens? I would say it's a great starter lens - so if that is what you want then go for it! But I have had friends who have owned this lens to only have it completely fall apart after only 1 year. The 1.8 AF is loud and slow. The 1.4 has a much sturdier build than the 1.8 with better auto focus and less noisy. From experience I would say that the 1.4 can even focus better in low light than the 1.2.The 1.4 is lighter than the 1.2 and feels better on the camera in my opinion - weight feels more evenly dispersed.For shooting video with 1.4 - it focuses better in low light than the 1.2, making shooting a low light scene easier. The 1.4 makes for some pretty footage.1.2L cons - size, weight, high price - And not all that different from the 1.4.1.2L pros - beautiful bokeh, sharpest of these 3 lenes, well made1.4 cons - bokeh not as good as 1.2, but better than 1.8. A little less sharp (but I haven't noticed that personally)1.4 pros - good price, quality, not too different than the 1.2 in picture quality1.8 cons - plastic build, slow and noisy AF, choppy bokeh with 5 blades over 8 in the 1.2 and 1.41.8 pros - great price, great starter lensI enjoy my 1.4 lens VERY much and I am glad I chose it over the 1.2. You need to decide what is important to you when picking a lens. In my case the $1000 price difference just did not make the 1.2 worth it.

This is desired from many, but I don't particularly care for it.  Nevertheless, shots become extremely sharp after 2.0 and continue to improve to f 8.0.As far as whether you should purchase this particular lens or the less expensive 1.8 model, it really comes down to personal preference.  Budget is an important issue as you can get one for less than $90 and the other for around 330. The less expensive one has a plastic mount, which wont last as long, and it just feels less solid.

They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a \"2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter\". Make sure the adapter is a \"stereo\" adapter versus a \"mono\" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick \"What to do\":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones...

The base unit itself has a toggle switch that lets you select between 3 channels. I have 3 units, all set to different channels, so I can tune into which ever one I want to at the time, and my brother and sister can too.

The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head.

The dynamic range seems very compressed around the vocal frequencies with the higher frequencies the most affected although the bass is also weak. Virtually none of my music sounds good. Only a few things which were already lacking in dynamic range originally sound just OK. Too much range and listening enjoyment is simply lost with these headphones.  I don't like them."}, {"review_id": "9e69f41dc0ab248a866d52cb98d569ea", "review": "When hubby was at work, I would often turn on a computer radio program to listen to while I did housework. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2\" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone."}, {"review_id": "715bd8c9f27bf6505a3ec214130dbd41", "review": "I read all of the reviews and bought these headphones.  I knew the Sennheiser name so felt I would be on the right track.  I have 3 pair of headphones.  A pair I bought at Radio Shack 5 years ago for $27 (bedroom), which died and is the reason for my purchase.  I also have the Sony headphones for $150 (TV room).  These cost $75 (bedroom).  My $27 headphones were the best in every way; sound, no problems, always worked.  Radio Shack no longer has the headphones.  When I first got the Senn headphones they worked 50% of the time and it was very frustrating.  We found out that when we had them plugged into the back of the TV (brand new LCD TV), that was the reason for them working only 50% of the time but when we plugged them into the back of our DVR, they work 100% of the time and we have had no more problems.  The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that they are not comfortable and fall of my head easily.  I didn't know they weren't the type that covers the whole ear.  The type that covers the whole ear are the most comfortable and the sound is better because your ear is encased.  Also they don't fall off.  When I'm sitting in bed watching TV with my head against a couple of pillows, it moves these headphones forward slightly off my ears and the sound is not as loud.

Still no go. Then I used another cable I had bought from the same vendor almost a year earlier, and the problem stopped. You could feel the difference in the tighness of the connectors of the last cable I tried.All three cables were from eForcity.  Don't know what to say about that except, buy more than 1 and preferably from different vendors. I think charging $20-$40 is criminal, but I would pay $10 for a known to be decent cable.  I think eForcity would eventually make it right, but a person would be more likely to think it's the hardware malfunctioning since the cable still works to some degree. That's what the 1.3b rating is about. Unfortunately there are no easy ways to tell if a cable is good other than to swap it out unless you have the proper measuring and testing equipment.Update 07/06/09--eForcity must be complimented for their customer service.  I received two replacement cables shortly after notifying them.They worked but I stuck with the original cable I had bought from them a year ago. As I stated before, apparently a cable can work for awhile and then fail partially due to the high data transfer rates. The replacement cables are working okay on another less sophisticated system.Great pricing, but you take a chance here. Also, the ad states HDMI 1.3b specs, but the packaging only says 1.3, which is not the same spec!I would upgrade eForcity's star rating just based on their customer service and the original cable I have from them but it can't be changed at this point."}, {"review_id": "948bc32d2f67483ea8de4b57a87a89e1", "review": "Whats to rate.

It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi.Initial, first-night impressions?  Heavenly.Compared to the other lenses that I've put on the business end of the XTi, the 17-85mm is one heavy dude.  I'd wager that it's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together.  The lens is serious.  It means business.  It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today.  It's a touch of the photographic high-tech, made accessible to the amateur.With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens' barrel, it didn't feel any less heavy but \"heavy\", in my mind, became \"solid\".  The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject.  The focusing ring is also nice and big -- it cries out to be grasped and twisted.  It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on, the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments.  (The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus, that is to say.)  The zoom is also smooth, the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length.Image stabilization is also a big plus.  I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it, it will save quite a few low-light, indoor, and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens.  This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all.  Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur.  But others worked out pretty well.After having used it for about two weeks or so now, most of these initial impressions have stayed true.  The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot.  You still need to have good light and the right angle, etc.; but with the right ISO setting, it can save the scene.  The heavy feeling of the lens is something I've gotten used to pretty quickly; after a couple of sessions, you just expect the camera to weight that much -- no worries.  I've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture -- I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before.That said, I'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens' chromatic aberration.  I've had a few shots that don't seem to \"resolve\" the same way during post-processing (in Aperture) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens (e.g., the 50mm prime).  This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens -- certainly not!  But I am trying to parse my way through some of these, experimenting with some different conditions, etc. to see where it lands.  I've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one, new lens.All things considered however, I've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far....so yeah, worth it.But with respect to \"worth it\":  Canon lists a retail price of $600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.  Most places online seem to offer it in the $475-$550 range.  As far as lenses go, this is hardly a costly one.  Considering that this is one of the two lenses \"given away\" as the kit lens for Canon's 40D body, you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit...?  Just the same, this is a great \"walk-around\" lens:  it is sturdy, has some great built-in features, and has a versatile range of focal lengths.  If you got this lens \"free\" with your camera body then you are in luck.  If you're looking to pick up one separately...  Well, it's a great lens to have.  And I'm happy with mine.  But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality, previously enjoyed lenses.Happy shooting, y'all."}], "B0002Y5WZM": [{"review_id": "cfb85c215d2e79a7f7d24e5355bb896f", "review": "This bag is  perfect for my present needs, and even has room for another lens in the future.

However, one should not discount the Rebel's plastic body. It's made of polycarbonate. I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make \"bullet-resistant glass.\" Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.Although a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.The Rebel XT is an excellent camera.

Excellent image quality.2. Faster than any P&S; digicam out there. No perceptible shutter lag!3. Can change your lens. That may not seem anything new to SLR folks but the P&S; crowd has been buying gazillion-MP $500+ digicams with crappy fixed lens.4. Large image sensor compared to 7MP Sony's or other XMP digicams. Gives you better picture quality and colors.5. Priced right, unlike some overpriced D-SLR out there, probably because Canon sells many more units.6. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and image processing features.7. LCD screen is bright and fluid, although it doesn't use any new technology like OLED etc.8. Uses standard CF cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card. You can buy 1GB for an affordable price.9. Lots of lens & accessory options from Canon and other vendors.Con's,1. The camera is still quite heavy and big. I guess that will remain so for most D-SLR's, for a while atleast.2. Not for professional use, only prosumer quality.3. Quite an expensive camera, out of reach of most people (unlike film SLR's). When other manufacturer's get it right, the price should fall significantly.4. LCD screen could have been bigger for such a bulky camera.5. Wish they come up with a way to show approximate picture for framing on LCD before shooting. Viewfinder is too cumbersome & old fashioned.I am almost sure Rebel XT will be THE best selling D-SLR of 2005, just like original Rebel in 2004.

I tried to program the old Marantz RC2000, but my wife could never figure out how to use it. I bought an early Pronto, but gave up when it couldn't tell if my TV was already on when I switched from cable to VCR, turning off the TV--and my wife couldn't figure it out. Several years ago, I bought a Harmony, the model number escapes me, but the screen was on the bottom and I had to scroll through menus, etc. It didn't do it for me either--and my wife couldn't figure it out.Finally, I began to search the net to see if things had improved since 2003. I ran across the Harmony \"One\" in a \"First Look\" from the CES and it seemed like it might be the ticket. The 880 came up as a good alternative when the \"One\" hadn't been released yet. I figured I'd order the 880 from Amazon, see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd send it back within the 30 days and order the \"One\".The 880 is great! I received it, logged on, set it up with all my components (Sony 52\" XBR4 LCD TV, Sony STR-DA5200ES receiver, DirecTv HR-20 HD DVR/Receiver, XBox 360 w/HD DVD drive (by the way, during the setup, the website asked me if my XBox 360 was standalone or had the HD-DVD drive as well--a real surprise), and a couple of other VCR/DVD/CD players/recorders), and have been having fun tweaking it the past 2 days. I did not experience any of the difficulties described in some of the other reviews. It sits in the cradle perfectly. The buttons are smaller than some remotes, but it makes it easy to reach most of them with my thumb holding it in one hand. I'm a big guy with a big hand. I don't like the numbers on the bottom, but something has to be on the bottom, and I use the numbers less often than the volume, channel up/down, mute, previous, joystick and transport keys.Before I ordered it, I wondered if it would have all the keys for my DVR without going through a hierarchy of menus. It has everything right on top, even a \"List\" soft button on the LCD readout when in \"Watch DirecTv\" activity. Pushing \"List\" shows me the programs I've recorded, and using the joystick allows me to select or delete just as the DirecTv remote does. Perfect.You can change the \"Activity\" names, such as from the default \"Watch PVR\" to \"Watch DirecTv\"; you can do away with cute icons behind each activity if it seems cluttery; in short, it's doing its job.I will keep the original remotes available for some of the really esoteric commands I might use occasionally. The 880 probably will do all those things through its menus, but I use them so seldom that it just isn't an issue.And my wife loves it!!"}, {"review_id": "d5acc9eb6ad90453a2cfe043e8ecc71a", "review": "I have to hand it to Logitech, they really did a great job with this remote.

It didn't set up very fast and took a number of tries to get the macros right for turning on the TV and switching input devices, but once it was set it's been great.  My kids are 12 and 15 and are thankful for the remote.  They don't have to ask for my help to play video games or watch a DVD anymore.A few particular features I like about the remote:1. The keys for the most part are backlit and when you move the remote the display and backlight are activated, you don't have to push a button.2. It is rechargable.  I hate having to replace batteries every few months.  It lasts almost a week on one charge... but I put it on the charger after about 3 or 4 days.  I don't want to chance being without this baby.3. It will learn commands from my other remotes.  This was very helpful when setting up the macro for switching TV inputs.  Even tho I put the TV make and model in it didn't know how to switch from SAT input to DVD input without a little learning.  This all depends on your TV.  Mine is a Mitsubishi WD-65733.  I also had to tell it what the inputs were called and which ones were listed in what order.  Beware... I think it was case sensitive in setup.4.  If you want to go into the advanced features of one of your devices without using the macros to do what you want to do you can still do that.  Just a double click of a button and you can set the surround sound on your stereo receiver or modify the night display on your DVD player... and so on.5.  It controlls my HD DVR from DirectTV so I can still FWD,RWD, pause, and record without any problems.  It does everything the remote for the device did.6.  You can upload your own photos to the remote and set them as the background in the display.What I don't like???There are really only two things I would change about it and that's the feel of the buttons and the ease of setup.  Some buttons are very small and they're hard plastic.  Some remotes have the nice big rubber buttons and for some people they really like those.  I don't know how you could make it easier but I did have to get it to learn a few commands from my TV remote.  Some people just aren't into computers and electronics much and could get frustrated by this.Over all, this is one sweet remote.  My friends are jealous when they come over.

I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the \"flavor of the month\". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR . Not by a long shot."}], "B000A6PPOK": [{"review_id": "670cf57ce370f54687c12207049bfbdb", "review": "I bought this keyboard because I have pain in my hands from being a long-time computer nerd. I'm a professional software developer, and this keyboard has made my job so much easier. I have one at home and one at work. And one non-functioning one on the shelf that was the victim of a water spill (unfortunately, no keyboard seems to be immune from liquid damage). I'll keep using one of these as long as they are around for me to use.The layout is great. It takes an hour or so to get used to it, but once you do, you'll find your typing speed and accuracy both increase. If you have pain in your hands, you'll find that this doesn't exacerbate it like other keyboards might. It's as easy as any keyboard to install, and I haven't had any problem with it working outside of the one I ruined by spilling water on it. Keys responds well, they don't need you to hammer on them, in fact you can type pretty gingerly on it.The \"candy\" on the keyboard isn't very functional to me, beyond the back-forward buttons near the space bar...I actually set those to skip through my music playlist. Love that feature! The zoom toggle in the middle...I reprogrammed that to be a scroll. I still don't use it all that often. I use the music controls at the top, and the calculator...but I don't really care about the shortcut keys. I suppose some people would find some functionality to them, I personally use Launchy to accomplish all that those things could do though.I love that this has the \"classic\" layout for the insert-delete-home key group, instead of turning all of those on their side.One thing that doesn't bother me, but might bother others: It isn't the quietest keyboard. It absolutely isn't loud, per se...but I've noticed that it gets louder with use. When I first get one, I'm impressed with the quietness, but it doesn't take more than a couple of weeks for that to wear down and things to get about as loud as any other keyboard of the same generation.One other thing I could do without, but is not at all unique to this keyboard: F-Lock. I actually found a script that disables the F-Lock key though...so it isn't so bothersome now, but the default functionality is annoying as all hell."}, {"review_id": "4bf0ff1fe81d8fd223942dd24512b42a", "review": "As with most Microsoft products, great hardware, poor software, but oh well.Now I'm using this thing right now, and I never noticed the spacebar thing, but it's true, if you don't press the spacebar correctly and press it on the upper area, it's hard to press down. I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of \"My\" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average)"}, {"review_id": "044f430e56955e09a7cdfb55491f6955", "review": "I hope Microsoft never stops making this keyboard, because now that I've tried one of the wave boards, I can't see ever going back to  a flat keyboard.

I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.

The Canon EF 28-135mm was my most used lens, and I still had it until March 2006 when I replaced it with the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L.Being an L lens, the dust and moisture resistant construction of the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sturdy.  The lens consists of eighteen elements in thirteen groups including one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion.  With a standard twist zoom focus, this lens permits for auto or manual focusing depending on how the switch is set.Some of the earlier lenses had an issue that caused lens flare.  This issue was resolved quickly with a recall.  If the control number located on the back cover of the lens begins with a UT and the following number is less than 1,000, then the lens is affected and should be sent in for repair.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L lens is compact measuring 5 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.5 lbs/670g, and accepts 77mm filters.  Be sure to get agood quality UV haze filterto protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well.  The f/stop ranges from 4 - 22. The closest focusing distance is 18 in/45 cm. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement. It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on myBogen 3231 monopod with legssuccessfully. A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs. Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures three stops below where you normally would. This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring. Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography. Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary. The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film. Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras. If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L includes a 1 Year US Warranty, the front & rear lens caps, theLP1219 soft pouch, and theEW-83H lens hood.  The hood will decrease chances of lens flare and increase metering accuracy. If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is similar in build a little shorter and weighs a couple ounces less.  Of course the Canon EF 28-135mm has a wider focal range.  Both lenses have single mode IS capabilities, and are good walkabout lenses.  Having used the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L the difference in weight and length is hardly noticeable.  The shorter focal distance is not missed, and I have a constant f/4 through out the focal scale unlike the Canon EF 28-135mm with a 5.6-36 on the long focal range.  The images using the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sharper and clearer than those using the Canon EF 28-135mm.If the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4.0L IS lens' price is not a problem, this is the lens to get. Otherwise purchase and enjoy the28-135mm IS lens.  The great thing about Canon lenses is they tend to hold their value.  If you want to upgrade from the 28-135mm, sell it on a popular auction site like I did.PROS:A compact L standard IS zoom that is an excellent walkabout lens.Versatile multipurpose lensCONS:A price typically found on L lensesMay become your most used lens"}, {"review_id": "d862b7ed9dfc84676e23e9d44fcc50ed", "review": "We are frequent hikers. Before we got this lens, we usually carried three lens:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L,Canon EF 50mm f/1.4and sometimesCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, and we paired them with our camera:Canon EOS 5D Mark II. So you can imagine how heavy is our backpack. We hope this lens can replace the other three lenses, such that it can cover landscape (24-35mm), portrait(50-85mm), and some wildlife at short distances (105mm). We understand that the quality may be sacrificed a little bit and may not be comparable to three other lens. We didn't expect that the difference is so big.We compared the image quality of this lens with the following lens. Notice that all images were shot at the same aperture/focal length. Also the scores below are relative/pair-wise.Candidate #1:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L, Shoot at f/4 and 24mmBoth lens give similar result. However, I notice that 24-105 have some vignette issues (dark corner) at 24mm. Also, the image is not as sharp as 17-40.If the score of 17-40mm is 100, then this lens is 80.Candidate #2:Canon EF 50mm f/1.4, Shoot at f/4 and 50mmThe 50mm lens blows this lens away. The color of 24-105mm looks just weird at this focal length, and the image is not sharp (I want to say poor).If the score of 50mm is 100, then this lens is 50.Candidate #3:Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, Shoot at f/4 and 105mmWe did some portrait shots at 105mm. Surprisingly, the difference is reasonable and not too big. Similar to other tests, sharpness is an issue.If the score of 70-200mm is 100, then this lens is 70.ConclusionThis lens behaves okay in its shortest/longest focal length (i.e., 24mm and 105mm), and the image quality degrades at around 50mm. In fact, this is not the only lens having trouble with this problem. Other lens such asCanon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L ISalso performs poorly at 50mm. However, this was fixed in Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8.Overall, the sharpness is a really big issue comparing to our collections. Although this lens offers a very attractive focal range, especially for hikers like us, we found that this lens is not a good fit for us because image quality matters than the weight of the lens.Suggestions:If you are using full-frame body, try to get aCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L I, or Canon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L.If you are using crop-sensor body, don't waste your time with this lens. This lens is optimized for full-frame body. Try to get a higher-end EF-S lens such asCanon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 ISinstead.Update (5/2/2014)I ended up selling my copy and get a copy of 24-70mm. Now I couldn't be happier. Many people are undecided whether they should get a 24-105mm (around $700), or they should buy a 24-70mm a f/4($1500), or even f/2.8 ($2300). Let's take the f/4 one as example. It is similar to 24-105mm (same aperture, with IS) except that its focal length is shorter (70 vs 105), and it costs nearly twice more expensive ($1500 vs $700). It doesn't make sense for Canon to make a more expensive and less powerful product. The difference obviously is image quality. Remember one thing: You get what you paid for.Further reading:I highly recommend to compare the image quality using the tools developed by The-Digital-Picture.com. You can easily find the link by searching \"Canon Review\" on Google. Go to Tools --> Image Quality and try to play around with different lens, aperture and focal length. That will give you the best side-by-side comparison."}, {"review_id": "625adbbb0049955e8f6198075725071c", "review": "I was lucky to be able to upgrade my camera kit and spent a lot of time shopping and debating.  I originally was going to get the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but someone in one of the forums suggest I look at this one.  Though I lost a stop of light, I was very much sold on the IS idea (hands shake) and the cost difference between the two allowed me to invest in the Canon 430 EX II flash, which was something else I really needed to invest in, so I decided the trade-off was worth it for my purposes.I've been using the lens now for about a week, experimenting with the IS, the focus, depth of field, etc.  I wanted to be pretty sure I knew what it could do before I wrote a review.Focus and focal range:  my camera focuses very quickly with this lens, and the full-time manual focus is great for those moments when the camera \"guesses wrong\" and focuses on, say, the post beside the bird instead of the bird itself.  I was pleased that 24-105 is workable as an indoor lens on a crop sensor camera.  I didn't run into any \"have to back up to get that picture\" moments so far.  It definitely isn't an ultra-wide lens on a crop sensor body, but can be used comfortably every day.  The zoom works well for the across the room zooms when you're trying to just get the subject's face in the camera, making this a great choice as a walk-around lens for most people photography.Sharpness:  I bought this at the same time as the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens, so I have a much sharper lens (the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II is a definite \"wow\" lens) to compare it to, so I will say this lens is acceptably, moderately sharp without a lot of post-processing.  Not as sharp as the 70-200mm f/2.8L lens (it also costs half as much), but sharper than the kit lens and the 55-250mm lens that I had with my T1i, requiring less post-processing to get a sharp image.  The colors are rich and the contrast is excellent, creating a pleasing image.Build quality and feel: if you are someone coming from the consumer lens category you will immediately notice the difference.  From the weight of the lens to the \"feel\" of the focus and zoom rings and the more quiet, assured zoom you realize there are reasons why L glass costs more beyond just the research and engineering required to make a higher quality image.  The IS also runs more quietly than the IS in the consumer-level lenses.  The lens is built dust and weather resistant, meaning that it can stand up to a little weather here and there, etc.  Additionally it comes with a pouch and lens hood included.  Unlike what I can research about the consumer hoods, the lens hood on L-glass comes with a flocked interior, which absorbs light better than the plain matte-black plastic.I am very pleased with my choice, and would definitely probably do the same thing again without hesitation.  Now I am debating between the 16-35mm f/2.8L II and the 17-40mm f/4L.  Decisions, decisions..."}, {"review_id": "d279cfc468d70b3aa55b22d2ea3ff29d", "review": "I use this lens on my 5d ii and have been quite happy with it for outside photographs.  I am a professional photographer and I love the 24-105 zoom -- it allows me to get environmental portraits -- i.e., a couple in front of a church or a small child on a beach -- and then I can zoom in for a more traditional portrait (the bokeh is quite nice at f4 105).  I find this zoom range essential for event photography.Indoors I am not quite as happy with this lens -- I have to ramp up my ISO pretty high as I am rarely on a tripod indoors (weddings and events).  If this lens came out in a 2.8 I would replace it in a heart beat, but I am not interested in the 24-70 2.8 because I would miss that extra focal length.Anyway, this is a great all around lens and is my favorite for event photography and as my personal \"walkabout\" lens when I'm on vacation.  Not too heavy, very versatile, and it takes excellent photographs.update:  Indoors with a studio setup, this lens is also FANTASTIC and is on my camera 80% of the time.  Because of focal length focusing issues, I can't use my 70-200, but I can get pretty close to my subjects and fill up the frame with the 24-105."}], "B000BKJZ9Q": [{"review_id": "2e2b6cb5bda443658b3ece3553cd9a72", "review": "I just received the Garmin Nuvi 350 as a Christmas gift. It had been on my Amazon wish list for about six months since Consumer Reports gave it such high praise. I was eager to try it out - and try it out I did!Having never had a GPS device before, I was concerned there would be a great deal of work to set it up and much to read before I could operate it.Not in the least!Out of the box, the device worked (literally! the battery had power right out of the box). It took me a few minutes of consternation to realize that the device couldn't see the satellite from inside the house so that it could set up my HOME setting. After 30 seconds in the open air, with the device doing the work for me, my Nuvi 350 was ready to go.Traveling around Atlanta can be tricky because of road construction and the spread out nature of the city. The Nuvi has proven to be reliable, even when I thought it was wrong. It had a better grasp of the directions than did I - a native Atlantan!Here's the nuts and bolts:Display - Great! It is easily legible even in bright light.Audio - They are clear and crisp with the ability to adjust the volume.Audio Directions - The audible directions are the best feature! I caught myself laughing, because the directions are clear and concise: \"Turn left in point 2 miles on to Oak St.\" And then when you are literally arriving at that intersection, you'll hear, \"Turn left on Oak St.\" How more precise can you get?  (It doesn't notify you every .2 miles - that's just my example - my point is it knows so exactly where you are that you get amazingly accurate directions).Menu - The menu is intuitive and has large graphical displays from which to choose.Menu items - The menu items are clear, although Locale doesn't really intuitively mean to me, what is intended here: language.There are ways to locate restaurants, gas stations, airports, shopping centers, etc.If you need a GPS device and you're needing one that is reasonably priced, then I couldn't be more positive about my experience with this Garmon Nuvi 350."}, {"review_id": "5d406ee83ae7b77931b6ca1504b05b97", "review": "Recently picked this up to replace a dated, although fully functional Garmin GPS-V and WOW what a difference!

This is more than I can say for the TOMTOM Go we use at work, which you consider yourself lucky if it can find itself out of your driveway.The voice prompts are clear and concise. You can even add various accents. I currently have mine set to the Australian female. (There are only female voices, by the way). The unit alerts you in plenty of time for you next turn, exit, etc. The unit also has a few other bells and whistles that I find more of a niche than neccessity, but all work well. Compared to my iPod Video 60GB, the MP3 audio is 95% as clean and the controls are very intuative. The photo viewer is a nice touch as well.All in all this is honestly THE best GPS out right now for mobile navigation.

Also, I like the size of it because my hands are big and I have something to hold on to.I like the big wide screen but don't be fooled, its still a 4:3 ratio and not 16:9.

You get a lot of options on how you want to view this library and you get a lot of options on how you create playlists. It took a while to figure out how to keep some files off the Zune (like screenshots for work that I had in My Pictures) but once you figure it out it makes sense.The sound quality is excellent and the reception on the FM radio is also excellent! It uses RDS to get song information and station identification. The interface is very clean and easy to use.Things that are missing that you should know about: The Zune cannot act as a USB hard drive. This is probably a big surprise to many. Also, the Zune cannot record either voice via microphone or its Digital FM signal.I like the Zune quite a bit. Its easy to use and shows quality workmanship. There are some missing features and the software has a short learning curve but for me the combination of its advantages are a real bonus."}], "B000F28DP2": [{"review_id": "7f7943bfd0caeab3c650be9b76b5d7cd", "review": "Three years ago I bought a Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 and it still is working well.

It does have amazing features and an amazing grip but it still has flaws that render it useless for some.Reliability:2 years, dropped so many times and still works like the first day I got it. I think it's reliable enough and the finish is great, not a single scratch.Installation:Is straightforward. You can use the Windows built-in drivers (plug and play) and it will work straightaway. However, if you want to use the many features of the mouse you'll have to install Logitech SetPoint.Software:SetPoint is OK. It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button). Older versions (I'm at 4.80) had problems in recognizing the mouse in Vista x64, this seems to have been solved from 4.xx.Features:Nevertheless it gives good flexibility in configuring the mouse. Which, in turn, comes with many features of which:- Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two. Or you can even let SetPoint automatically decide based on your scrolling speed.- The wheel itself would act as left/right buttons if you push it to the sides. I never used this feature and as I don't find it easy. It's not very comfortable really.- 2 additional buttons on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like.- A 2nd wheel...ish thing.. It's useful to scroll through open windows.The mouse feels great in the hand and is quite comfortable but it may need to be elevated slightly higher than the normal position comfortable for the keyboard. This of course also depends on how big your hands are, mine are big.Tracking:Is great. Works fine on almost all surfaces I tried it on. You will hardly find a surface that this mouse doesn't track on.Speed:Not the best feature. 800 dpi and response (or refresh) rate is way low. I'm not sure if this is wireless lagging or because of the sensor itself but the mouse is SLOW so forget using it for fast action gaming. Seriously, forget it and go look somewhere else if you want this mouse for gaming. THAT, and add to it how HEAVY the mouse is, it WILL set you back in games.Wireless:Bad. It interferes with 2.4GHz wifi. I changed routers, changed channels, changed all kinds of settings in my wifi network and it still interferes like crazy. Of course this only happens when there is heavy load on the wireless network - like downloads or something. But you would expect better from Logitech. This is not acceptable.Because of speed and the wireless problems I finally gave up on it and purchased a wired habu (microsoft-razer). Yes, it's old but I got it for a good price and honestly I didn't know what I was missing. I didn't want to take another chance with Wireless for now (although another cheapo mouse I have has no issues with wifi whatsoever) and I wanted something lighter and faster (which wireless mice normally lack). And I'm very happy with it. Hence, I decided to finally come and write this review."}], "B000HJPK2C": [{"review_id": "add5f4e10b8415927649d476436771c6", "review": "I own and have used the lens for over 3 months now. I have experienced some softness out beyond 200mm while using it on auto-focus, but I am learning to work within the limits of the lens. Given what has been said in some reviews about softness out past 200mm (and my own initial experience) I decided to run some tests for how sharp the pictures could really be. The one caveat I had is that for the tests I ran I used manual focus - I wanted to test the optics not the AF or VR functions since they are not a requirement for using the lens. Also, I am starting to get very interested in Equestrian photography. I need the long zoom and have found that pre-focusing on a point, rather than depending on Auto-focus is much more effective for obtaining the results I am looking for.For my test I used this lens mounted on a D300 to take some pictures of a bell tower. Because I was specifically testing the lens for sharpness past 200mm (I shot several at 300mm) I focused the lens manually, and used a tripod. As it turned out there was chain link fencing over the opening to the bell which I could not see, from where I was standing in a parking lot across the street. That made my test even better.I then took several shots of the bell and the tower, being careful to focus the lens on specific characteristics of the bell. The shots were all sharp. I then downloaded and examined the photos at high magnification on my PC. I did not lose any significant resolution of the chain link (which I could only make out after I downloaded the pictures) or the objects I was focused upon until I viewing the shots at 200% or greater magnification. At that point you could actually begin to see the individual pixels. So I have to say that I do not agree with the reviews about how the lens gives poor results out past 200mm. I have obtained excellent results through the entire zoom range.I will say that the AF-S system for the lens seems to hunt a lot when there are a lot of objects in the field of view (i.e., the leaves on a tree while trying to photograph a bird), so it does sometimes focus on something other that what I want - that could have been what the others were complaining about. But if I assure myself that it is focused on my target and use the AF lock built into the camera that problem goes away. Also if I use the lens on manual focus the problem goes away.I am very happy with the lens and highly recommend it. I believe it is an outstanding value for the price."}], "B000HZDF8W": [{"review_id": "d5a5d2fd0c9677bd943d53fd7f551112", "review": "I love the companion 5 speakers after hearing those speakers the companion 2 will sound like a total disappointment. on the other had these speakers are perfect for those who love extra bass.

Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to! The AF is way faster and quieter, the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports, the body feels great (maybe not for small hands) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f/4L. I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it. I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera, however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras.

The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press \"pause\" then \"play\" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The \"alarm\" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say \"The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me\" but I'm not totally sure that's true.If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had.

It's as close to perfection as any digital camera has ever come. Sure, there are \"better\" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera."}], "B000LRMS66": [{"review_id": "2639cabfd43479ca8f019088f0ebd18d", "review": "Not much to add; it's designed for a specific purpose, and it accomplishes it perfectly.

I read the 2008 Consumer Reports Regza review and agree with it for the most part. Overall, the TV can be an excellent value, and possesses picture capabilities that exceed several other more expensive brands. It has plenty of inputs for various devices and is easy to operate. It has a severely limited viewing angle that should be considered carefully by some potential buyers and that is the primary reason that I cannot give it a \"five star\" rating. I would probably recommend the Samsung LNT 4661 based upon reviews. It has \"as good\" or better picture quality and a better viewing angle. A comparable Sony will cost at least $400 more than the 47HL167 and you may not notice any difference in picture quality.The picture quality is very good with Standard Def DVD's, and excellent with high definition sources such as PC video files, satellite, over the air broadcasts, and Blu-ray discs. However, viewing angle may be an issue for purchasers who have seating too far to the side of the screen. Imagine the television at a 6 o'clock position. The picture is fine, if you are seated between the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, but color begins to fade very noticeably when fanning out further. For those with a shallow viewing distance and wide room, I recommend that you steer clear of the 47HL167. The limited viewing angle is very noticeable to me and was cited by Consumer Reports. Imagine my surprise that hardly any Amazon reviews mention it.The colors are very vivid and the 47HL167 has numerous adjustments to help each viewer satisfy their own preference. I suspect that those who have encountered problems with \"Green or Blue Push\" have not adjusted the settings to their liking, or might possibly have defective sets. I have not noted any \"color issues\", though the 47HL167 does have setting modes labeled \"Cool, Medium, and Warm\" which can render the overall color in the direction of blue or green. Motion blur hasn't been noticeable either. Sharpness is excellent. No blotchiness or muddled lines are present.The blacks are very good and I recommend that you ignore concerns about the black quality of LCD versus Plasma unless you are a very discerning viewer. Grey hued black-levels evident with old and/or cheap LCD screens is not a problem. The only greyness that I have noticed is during credits and pre-movie viewing screens with poor quality DVD recordings. During movie playback blacks are black. Partly due to the LCD technology, but also because of the matte screen coating on this particular model, inky black levels of the highest quality plasma set is not obtainable. Other LCD models may have darker black rendering, but probably giving up the advantage of using the 47HL's matte screen. For most viewers, the difference is marginal enough, that it is only noticeable during side-by-side comparison to another model.Two strong characterstics of the LCD technology and the 47HL in particular should be considered. LCD offers a brighter colors and the matte screen option. Though, the Plasma TV offers a darker black, it is marred by the fact that the screen will reflect light from darker screen shots and appear dim in brightly lit rooms. In fact, the displays at the major retail stores illustrate this phenomenon very readily with multiple TV's broadcasting the same scene. The LCD TV's show little to no lighting glare or reflectivity, while the plasma will reveal the room distinctly in a mirror like fashion. The performance of the 47HL and its matte screen coating is excellent in brightly lit rooms and does not suffer from any mirroring effect. Fast moving action scenes are rendered without flaw. No dead pixels have been observed. The screen is easy to clean.Aside from picture viewing considerations, I can't find reason for complaint. Sound quality is fine, and no abberation (like buzzing cabinet resonance) is apparent. Bass and Treble can be adjusted and the unit also has three separate adjustments for Surround Effects. For movies I turn to my AV Stereo system to provide sound, but for TV broadcasts I find the TV speakers suitable. Three  hdmi inputs are adequate, if not using an AV Receiver to handle connectivity/switching chores. The 47HL167's remote control works fine for me, despite lack of back-lighting. I was able to add codes to control the disc players and satellite receiver, but couldn't get the much loved \"commercial skip\" functionality when watching shows recorded on Dish DVR.The TV includes the noteworthy three HDMI inputs, but has plenty of other connectivity options for non-hdmi equipped components: PC, DVD, cable box and antenna. You should be able to avoid using the composite or S-video inputs which result in much lower video quality. I observed very poor quality with S-video connections to a PC, DVD player, and Satellite DVR. For those computer owners who plan to use DVI adapters, beware that you may lose access to other HDMI inputs, if using an adapter on the TV side of the connection. The HDMI inputs are close together and the width of the DVI male connector and corresponding adapter will block the adjacent HDMI input(s). I recommend spending a few extra dollars and use a cable that transitions from a DVI connector on one end to HDMI on the other.The 47HL167 is very comparable in price to similar models offered by competing brands. Though you'll see it listed as high as $2,100, it is usually priced around $1,800 retai, and there have been several special sales on this TV (the lowest sales offering at $1,299).Also note that the 47HL167 will need about 15 seconds to power up, if in the power saving mode. I have encountered trouble when switching to my DVR before the TV is fully powered up. Switching to the input too quickly sometimes brings up a blank screen and a loud pop is emitted from the speakers, when trying to switch between inputs to correct the problem. At this point you'll have to shut off the TV. An alternative is to put the TV on a power mode setting that starts it more quickly, but prepare for a higher electric bill, since the TV will be using power continuously. I suspect that the issue may be caused by the DVR since the problem is absent when selecting other devices.In summary, I highly recommend the Toshiba Regza for those that view the TV from within the limited viewing angle and plan to watch DVD's and High Definition content. If low price is priority, the Olevia and Vizio are fairly competitive. If picture quality is most important, but at a cost under $1,800, then Samsung may be the better choice. Only highly discerning viewers will enjoy the benefits of a costlier LCD model or want to address the problems with plasma technology."}], "B000N99BBC": [{"review_id": "790c2331a749ffe5e42605e44c6133a0", "review": "Switches are a big seller of mine and useful in many situations. They are the simplest networking device there is -- no setup, no configuration, just plug and go.This is used when you have a device that does the routing (a router than gives IP addresses) and you don't have enough ports for all of your wired devices. You can also use it in a situation where you have one computer jack in an office or room, but more than one device.I used a network cable to plug from the router to the new switch and plugged in my devices into the switch and they all instantly worked. If you are expecting a speed increase, make sure that your computer has a gigabit ethernet port -- most business computers have had that for quite a few years now and I'm not sure what they are putting in home computers.I also have installed more than a dozen of this exact switch (beginning in December 2011) in many locations without one failure so far.

The hardware is fine, but as many here have indicated, the product is only fully realized with good software maps, which are purchased separately (from Garmin). Now I have not had good luck with my handheld GPS's: one stopped working, I lost 2 of them, and a fourth got run over by a car in New Zealand. Of course no one would expect a replacement for a lost device, so I bought new ones FROM GARMIN. But I then had also lost use of the maps that I purchased, and Garmin will not authorize you to use a map you previously purchased on a new device. As was told to me by a (friendly) phone rep, Garmin makes most of its money on software.Now there are people who will cheat by perhaps selling or giving away a device with software and then ask for free replacements. So it's understandable that Garmin guards against that. But they are totally rigid about this policy, and my experience shows that it's greed rather than a concern about cheaters that is involved. When my expensive Garmin unit got run over and damaged, I offered to send the damaged unit back as proof that no one else was using the software, and they still insisted that I had to buy new software for the new GARMIN GPS I had just bought as a replacement.I think a customer-friendly company (like Amazon) would make some good-faith exceptions, especially with a customer who had bought so many of its products (and repeated software purchases). You should know before buying a Garmin product that Garmin is not that kind of company. The latest map involved is one that is 5 years old, not all that valuable, but still Garmin would not replace it. And the one that is on this device (the one that comes free with the Venture HC) is, as other reviewers note, not very good, so if you buy this product, you will probably also want to buy some good maps to go with it. Just know what the Garmin policy is about this and what kind of company mentality is involved. Don't think, for instance, that if you pay for the maps and then just decide to upgrade to a better device and want to send in the old one to Garmin to show you aren't using the maps on two device that you will not have to pay again for the software. You will have to pay, whatever the reason that you are not using it on the original device--because that's how Garmin makes more money."}], "B000Q8UAWY": [{"review_id": "4941db6767117695d0b02d3768a19811", "review": "I got this mini hub as a freebie at a trade show and I am using it occasionally, while on the road - I preemptively plug in the thumb drives that I need and then I attach the entire assembly to whatever machine I may be using when I need them.

Chose the ASUS Black Knight N66U router as our primary networking device, a dual band 450 Mbps device, which then led to the need for higher speed wireless adapters on a few key computers to take advantage of the higher router speeds, and after much research, chose the TRENDnet 450's to match the router specs.  Have installed these on work laptop and audio workstation desktop so far, and will purchase another for home server when get that up and running.Honestly, I've been moving away from the old stalwarts like Netgear, Dlink, and especially LinkSys (after Cisco acquisition), as I don't think they are on the leading edge of performance, reliability, and ease of use any more.  TRENDnet, on the other hand, seems to be on the rise, and offering good price/performance, especially on the adapter side.  Had a TRENDnet 300 Mbps 2.4GHz dongle that worked very well, so that and reviews led me to the 684UB.Conclusion, the TRENDnet 684UB is an very good low priced choice!  However, for MAXIMUM throughput, get the slightly more expensive but worth it Asus USB-N66ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N900 USB Network Adapter (USB-N66)First and foremost, am getting much higher link speeds than via old N and G adapters linked to my previous dual band N router (Netgear WNDR3700 dual band 300Mbps).  Am seeing up to the rated 450 Mbps link speed with the TRENDnet 684UB working with the Asus Black Knight, especially on 5GHz band, and had never exceeded 100 Mbps with previous setup.  2.4 GHz link speeds are up as well, 50-100%, despite the crowding in that band in general and where I live specifically.  I know link speeds are not the same as throughput, BUT, throughput is some *fraction* of link speed, so, if you don't get the higher link speed, you are limiting throughput as well, and now, I can work with the maximum *potential* speed that 802.11N currently provides.  Have not done formal speed/throughput benchmarking, but will update this review if I do.  Real world speed FEELS fast, and much faster than previous setup.Second, these adapters are really small!  No, they are not a USB dongle in size, but I want speed first and foremost for this application, and the device just needs some physical size for antennas to send and receive at these new higher 802.11N speeds.Setup was drop dead easy, just downloaded the latest driver and utility bundle from the TRENDnet site (I almost never use included CDs with devices, as the drivers are almost always out of date), installed, plugged in, and connected to my router with WPA2-PSK security (this specific security protocol is necessary to get to the top speeds in the 802.11N spec).Another cool thing I am testing is on my laptop, where I have both the built-in dual band 300 Mbps Intel radio and now the TRENDnet both operating simultaneously.  Have not done any benchmarks yet that would measure the benefits of such a setup, but I'm intrigued.  And it's just plain cool to have 2.4 and 5 GHz connections show up simultaneously in Windows wifi taskbar app.Summing up...Pros+ True 450 Mbps link speeds on 5GHz band in real world (router two rooms away thru three walls)+ Very small size - 3\" tall by 2\" wide+ Can locate device for optimum reception via USB cable+ GREAT price+ Easy setup, can be managed by Windows or through optional utility software+ Looks like a high tech shark fin :-)Cons- Throughput drops under load, as noted by others elsewhere (- 1 star).- Utility software is kind of primitive, but seems to work fine.  I did notice at one point that I had to enter my SSID password in both the TRENDnet utility and Windows Wireless Networking for things to work right, but kinda serves me right for leaving both enabled - heh hehTips* Location/orientation.  Move the adapter around, changing orientation, height, location, to get the best signal, and watch the link speed change to see which location provides best link speed.  I just held the adapter in many different positions for a few seconds and eyeballed the average link speed to find out what was best.  Turned out location/orientation within the range of the bundled USB cable could affect speed by  as much as 50%!  For me, higher was better (perhaps obviously), and the best orientation was sideways hanging off the edge of my 26\" LCD, with the lights facing down.  Hmmm... but it works.* Tune your router.  The router is of course the other key enabler of overall network performance.  Each router is different, but on the Asus Dark Knight I'm using the already mentioned WPA2-PSK security on both bands, 40MHz channel width on 5GHz band, and 20/40 Auto on the 2.4 GHz band, and, critically, power output turned up to the 200 mW maximum.  The latter REALLY helps both bands, but especially the 5GHz link speeds.Highly recommend the 684UB for those who have dual band 450 Mbps routers and need a high performance, reasonably priced adapter to match."}], "B000R9AAJA": [{"review_id": "2607b95a8388143f24b915cfaaf156e3", "review": "I bought these because my computer's internal speaker is very quiet, but was of pretty good quality nonetheless.Basically, the sound quality on these speakers is pretty good for the value.

It's a little more contoured, but isn't gigantic where you're gonna rest your hand on it.Great feature is you can set 5 different sensitivity points on it in 200 intervals from 200-3200.  Any 5 you want!  Easy to change and play around with.Only negative I have so far is the weights.  Like I said, using the \"claw\" grip one picks up the mouse from time to time with the thumb and pinky/ring fingers.  Well the weights are in the back/rear side of the mouse, so when I pick up the mouse it tilts/pivots back a little which DOES move the cursor initially.  Used to the 50/50 weight distribution and possibly mice not SO sensitive!  Maybe I need to play with the weights a lil more, play with my grip, or just remove them entirely (which is a shame as it takes that feature of the mouse away).  Might have to hand make a little weight at the top where the cord goes in to balance it out if I get that industrious."}], "B000VM60I8": [{"review_id": "27ac65d0129d0cba22ef062dfafe2e2f", "review": "the issue with this package is that from the camcorder to the PC, the picture is quite good.

Previously, I only had experience with chain store backpacks but the DR-467 is a cut above. It has tons of features, superb build quality, and excellent padding. Exterior is somewhat anonymous however this is a plus for me as I sometimes travel through dodgy areas and need a backpack that doesn't attract unwanted attention.It is compact, reasonably light-weight and has a slim profile. The bright yellow interior lining is very helpful for finding gear in low light. Has lots of pockets for organization. Laptop section fits my 17\" just fine. Back padding is a little stiff. Lower gear compartment is attached by Velcro and can be completely pulled out. Compact size is not suitable for giant gear or very long lenses but medium zoom and primes should be fine. Top compartment is very roomy and has a slot to poke mp3 player headphones through.Straps are very comfy. Zippers have smooth travel. Reflective cloth is embedded in zippers and straps. Rain cover is a nice plus as is zip out drink holder. The only complaint I have is no tripod holder and would like a dedicated keychain hook. My Slik 340EZ tripod fits in the laptop compartment so it's no biggie.

I don't need the ability for real-time monitoring. I don't need to watch anything over the Internet. All I need is the ability to go back and see what happened at a certain time.How I have setup this product:1. I have placed the camera in a place and position to capture the maximum activity. Camera clamp can be rotated in two axes, but the third axis is rigid. I think they should redesign the clamp/fixture such that there is complete freedom to adjust the camera.2. I have placed the receiver about 10' away such that both antennae are in line.3. Connected the receiver via Dazzle video converter to a computer.4. Computer is kept always on constantly recording the video.Issues with the above setup: (1) I have to change the video file about once a day and delete old files periodically (2) only I know how to manage the whole setup - too much technology for the family (3) captured digital video size (width and height) is small and quality is poor.Alternative setup: Instead of connecting the receiver to a computer, I tried connecting it to an old VCR. Much simple to operate. I have used 6-hour VHS tapes. With this setup, picture size is as big as the TV, picture quality is abysmal. Low tech and family can manage the setup. More maintenance in that the tape should be changed every 6 hours.I am currently satisfied with the setup. Happy with the product - it does what I need and I didn't have to pay a lot.

Instead, the buttons are made of cheap plastic and have the feel of a a $29.00 organizer you might buy at Walgreens. The keys on the remote and the remote itself are slippery and the ergonomics of holding the remote appear to fit the hands of a species not of this earth. It is much easier to press the buttons on my Sony or Tivo.Its also very easy to press the wrong item on the LCD as the choices on the LCD are very close together.The main thing this unit is good for (when it works) is turning multiple components on or off in sequence. Because the remote is clumsy to manipulate, turning the components all one as programmed often doesn't work. There isn't much tolerance for not aiming it at the sweet spot of your components which you have to determine by trial and error.The macros are nice, but the unit is slower than the native remote, ie the Tivo so it somewhat offsets using the macros. Once I turn on my components I now just start using the Tivo remote until I am ready to turn all my components off.Essentially, for me this is a $200.00 device to turn my components on or off."}, {"review_id": "e99dc0838eb52c04d87b6d94c27e51d3", "review": "I have only had the remote for 3 days, so these are just preliminary findings.  This remote is being used to control : Hitachi 32HDL51 TV, DishNetwork DVR-625, Sony STR-DA7ES receiver, JVC HR-S9911U VHS, HP Z540 computer, Archos AV-500 PVR and an X10 light controller.  So far the only problem I've had is with the X10 controller, but I haven't put any time into debugging it.The computer I am using for programming the remote is a Dell E521 ( AMD 64X2 5600+ processor ) running Windows XP Pro SP2. Installing and running the software was quite straightforward ( I'm on a 3Mbps DSL connection ).  I find the software to be fairly intuitive, but did note the \"strange\" English that other reviewers have mentioned.The only glitch I ran into when doing the initial setup for the remote was that the software wanted to \"read\" some of the signals for the DVR-625 and the Sony receiver though I had checked before buying the remote to make sure they were supported.  It then occurred to me that both of these units have TWO remote controls ( both have two-room capability ).  The software was just checking to see which remote I was using.  BUT that showed me that the folks who have complained about the remote's learning capability have legitimate concerns.  I have had a number of teachable remotes, and this is the first one I've had a problem with.  The main problem seemed to be lighting - I had to turn off a lamp about 3 feet away before I had any success at all.  Then, if I had the remotes about 3\" apart, and pressed the button for no more than 1 second, the signals were received ok.  This is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than 5 star.I spent most of today setting up the \"favorite channels\" on the remote.  The only reason it took so long was that I searched the web for appropriate icons to use, then had to edit them to get 75x44 pixel images ( don't try to use any other size - the icons \"stretch\" to fit 75x44 ).  A really good source for \"nice\" icons is [...]After getting the icons, setting up the favorite channels feature was a breeze.  And, best of all, it actually works.As far as the physical design of the remote, I find it very easy to use.  A lot of thought went into the placement of the buttons, and I have no trouble using it with \"one hand operation\".  The remote I replaced with this one was also a touch-screen ( rather old Sony one ), so I have no problem with the touch-screen.  I also have fairly small fingers, so that may help!  It is a fairly small screen.  I find the lighted buttons to be extremely useful, and it's pretty neat that they turn on as soon as you pick up the remote.  I can't comment too much on the battery life, since I've only had it for 3 days.  But the battery indicator hasn't moved very far from full during that time.In conclusion, I'm quite satisfied with this remote.  Before buying one, make sure it will control your components with a minimum of \"teaching\", because that's a real bummer.  You can check all your components on Logitech's home page.Added after initial review:  Just noticed the remote wasn't really turning the DishNetwork DVR on or off.  The \"help\" and \"device\" could turn it on/off, but not the \"activity\".  I wasn't able to correct the problem with any of the adjustments, but the setup allows one to add steps to activities.  I added a \"select\" to turn it on and \"power toggle\" to turn it off.

It's by far the cheapest lens I own (the others are the $700+ Canon 15-85, the $400+ Canon 60 macro, the $400 Tamron 28-75).I considered getting the Canon 70-200mm f/4 IS L lens but for 5x the price you get less zoom range, a heavier and bulkier lens, and perhaps a little more snob appeal with the white barrel and that precious red ring.  No doubt the L lens surpasses this one when you photograph test charts (how often do you do that?), and its weather sealing allows it to withstand thunderstorms better, but frankly speaking, if you're not a pro who pushes the envelope, who cares?If you have a crop camera, this lens lets you take advantage of the smaller sensor - you're not paying for (and lugging around) all that extra glass.  Maybe the extra $800 you spend on the L lens will make a difference in 1% of your photos, but you realize the benefit of the lighter weight and smaller size 100% of the time.  Plus you're more likely to bring it with you.Yes, at longer focal lengths you lose one f-stop compared to the L lens.

Apparently, the IS effect is quite noticeable in the viewfinder but isn't quite translated to the pic. Perhaps, the light weight Rebel camera also has an effect.

However, the auto-focus doesn't work all that well if the lighting isn't perfect.  Given a nice sunny day, the auto-focus is very responsive and accurate.  If you're indoors, or shooting at dusk, be prepared to wait up to several seconds for the focus to be set; if it can acquire focus at all.  I find that if I am dealing with dim lit shots of a static subject, manual focus is much more effective.Upon the first use of this lens, I thought something was broken.  This is because the image stabilization makes a light grinding noise.  While the noise can be annoying while taking pictures, it can be catastrophic when recording a video.  Consider that the grinding noise is coming from a lens directly attached to the camera.  This grinding travels very well to the internal microphone, and is forever recorded with your video.As a side note: It would also be nice if Canon started putting their lens caps on leashes.

Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i  commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i  had a pleasant experience.

This lens is unusual for a 50mm as they are typically rather small. This one is much larger than the Nikon/Canon variants (other than the Canon 1.2 of course!!!). But still, it is not THAT big. Feels real good on my D700. I also LIKE the 77mm filter size as that is somewhat of a standard filter size in Nikonland and I have them already! This compares favorably, for example, to the new Nikon 50 1.4 AFS as that takes an unusual filter size for Nikon shooters (58mm).Anyway, this lens is solidly constructed, as I would expect from a Sigma EX lens. It also focuses quickly, accurately, and quietly, with the well implemented HSM focusing system that Sigma has developed. It is also sharp, acceptably-so wide open, and razor sharp stopped down a bit. Nice bokeh. Combine this with a D700 or D3 and you have perhaps an incomparable low combo! You cannot believe the shots you can make with this lens and those Nikon bodies in very dim light. I like how the lens handles. Jeez, I just like everything about it!!!

After some extensive research and shopping around I decided on these and I could not be happier. The build quality of these is exceptional. They are thick and well shielded and the picture and sound quality is equal to that of the 8x more expensive Monster cables.

There are many people out there trying to make the decision of the 3 wonderful cameras. I can only share my analysis based on my need and experience, as an avid amateur photographer.D600: the solid pro-sumer body feels the same as D7000, which I also own. Nikon transplanted the FX heart into a DX body. It is very natural for D7000 owners to upgrade to D600 for the ease of use on functions and layouts. However, I dislike the AF system concentrating mainly in the center, which can be challenging when trying to focus under certain situations. In addition, the problem of the occasional oil spell/dust on the sensor issue can be an indication of quality control problem of this model. I have tried to clean camera sensors before; it is far from easy to do so, wet or dry method. Therefore, most professionals dissuade the general public to do so and recommend leaving the job to the authorized dealers. Believe me, it is beyond annoying when you see spots on your pictures; and sometimes the spots appear in the place that can be very hard to correct.D800: nice pro heavy body with a huge 36mp sensor. Upgrading from a DX, I can not justify spending (jumping) thus much on such a powerful camera. Instead, as most professional photographers suggest, I will spend more on quality lenses, which usually out-last the cameras. If you own D800, you'd better have pro lenses. Otherwise, all the \"defects\" will show up in pictures with its huge and powerful sensor. In addition, D800 also has its own quality control issues, which is back focusing. Also, as an amateur, I tend to shoot more pictures than the pros, making sure I get the pictures I want. Therefore, I end up with a good number of pictures after an assignment and it takes time to process them. I am not ready to store (space-wise) and process (time-wise) big files from the D800 yet... maybe much later.D700: I picked this \"old\" camera over the two new models. It is a pro body, weather sealed, similar weight to D800. The layout is not too different from D7000 (thank goodness!) and easy to get used to. Since it is discontinued, the price dropped to the level that it is quite affordable, especially used ones, though be careful with the \"used\" condition, as it varies A LOT! This is the trial-and-true cameras, a work horse for many professionals. Despite having an older sensor, D700 still can produce exceptional images with wonderful sharpness and color rendition. Pairing it with the right lenses, you get \"gallery\" quality photos/prints. I don't worry too much of the \"small\" 12 mp sensor. As an amateur, most of us don't print over 2'x3' anyway. Its renowned focus system is outstanding, right on everything every time I shoot!I care about the image quality (what my eyes can see), body built (how my hands feel), and the focus system (the first and foremost ingredient in sharp image). I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures. Currently, the D700 fits my need, my budget, and the overall quality I am looking for. After all, all the equipments are \"tools\" at best. It is the photographer that takes good or bad pictures. A soft but well-composed picture is not as bad as a sharp yet meaningless one."}], "B001CCLBSA": [{"review_id": "66924302bf6d8ea235a19e6a84afcf36", "review": "This is a good little camera. I thought long and hard before I gave it only three stars. But, despite it being better than any other compact, I still have lots of criticism.The good:The image quality is very strong. Not as good as the DP1/2, but that camera is a disaster in nearly all other regards. With F/2 and and 400 you'll likely get the indoor shot you need. And when that fails, 800 is tolerable. The LX3 is a zippy performer too. While a little slow on the startup, the auto-focus is decently quick (could be better) and the shot to shot performance is quite good. The full-auto mode is good too. Hand the camera over to a novice and he/she will get a good shot. Love the aspect ratio.The meh:The zoom range is a little limited. But I'm not too bothered by it. Other than macro, I can't imagine the manual focus ever being usable. I'd gladly give up some screen real estate for a viewfinder (even an evf). An integrated lens cap would have been a nice touch, as would a wrist strap. It'd be nice if the RAW format were more open. At the time of this review Aperture doesn't support it at all and Lightroom only kinda supports it.The bad:My main complaint is the interface. It's not awful. In fact it's probably better than most compacts. But this camera had so much manual potential, only to be let down my too many darned buttons. The user programable setting are a good example. It has four presets. But only two of them are really useful. The other two require you to turn the dial, hit the select button, navigate down and then confirm; you just missed your shot. I wonder why it would be so difficult to have two or three more dials on the camera to control shutter, aperture and ISO? Instead, we get the worlds tiniest joystick. Again, by the time you've actually changed a setting you probably missed the shot. Also, why is a manual focus that goes around the lens so hard to implement? It's such a wonderful convention that is almost never seen on a compact.The wrap up:I do really like this camera. It's a good RAW shooter with good quality; all in a compact package. But, I hope that Panasonic really concentrates on the fundamentals for the LX4. A viewfinder and a couple of dials or knobs would have made this a four star camera for sure. If they managed to squeeze a larger sensor in too, it would be the best camera of all time.The unrelated:Shame on Amazon for allowing price gouging from their partners. Currently (April/May 2009) the LX3K is quite scarce. I ended up paying a reasonable $50 over MSRP. But during the shortage the camera has been on sale for as much as $750 ($250 over MSRP!). Capitalism, the free market and supply/demand are all good things. But I'm a little offended that Amazon would allow their customers to be bludgeoned by such heavy pricing.

I have had a Lumix FZ20, a Sony 717 and a Minolta 530.For the money the LX3 is simply amazing, but don't expect to be in the same league as the reflex camera, especially at high ISO. If there are lots of shadows I don't like using my LX3 above ISO 400 (that's a subjective assessment). I get about a 2 EV advantage with my D300.The zoom is not especially powerful, but it's so bright and compact I imagine it would have been difficult to design one that would have been at F/2.8 all the way.The depth of field is of course much greater than my larger cameras because the focal length is so small, so it can be an advantage in many situations, and a disadvantage for taking portraits.It doesn't feel that slow, probably because I expect compact cameras to be slow.The quality of the image stabilizer amazes me: I'm able to take many pictures inside museums and have had better results than with my reflexes when I wasn't using stabilized lens. Pictures at a 15th of a second are tack sharp.There is very little chromatic aberration in the lens.The flash is occasionally over-powerful.The video quality is so much better than what I had before.I take this camera everywhere, which is more than what I can say about my reflex cameras.It looks good.On the negative side the manual is not especially well written, but finally you can figure out a lot by just exploring the menus.All in all I would give it four and a half stars, but given the price and the use I get out of this camera I'll give it 5."}], "B001CS7UAM": [{"review_id": "babb137f38c95b1bbd5ebd52b82412dd", "review": "***** Update 4/30/2012  -  Apparently the 3/25 problem with charge and retention was related to the original \"too short\" flaw.  Seeing the tape I used to build up the end had compressed a lot under the camera battery's retention clip, I improved that fix and the charge and retention are back.  After a thousand flash-less test pictures there is power left in the charge from a few weeks ago.

I've had better all-round luck with Power2000 *****I bought this extra battery for my Olympus Stylus with high hopes since a different battery from a different \"No Name\" brand works well in my Canon camera.  On arrival the battery looked just like the Olympus original but when I put it in the camera nothing happened.Since rechargable batteries usually arrive with enough charge to at least turn on the equipment, I wondered if the thing was DOA.  I tried charging the battery several times in the camera without success in any way.  Again I figured DOA.For some reason I eventually tried pressing the battery down lightly inside the battery compartment with my finger and turning the camera on.  ...It worked...  And it worked fine every time I tried it.When installed, the battery is a \"hair\" too short to touch the contacts inside the battery compartment.  The original Olympus battery has NO HINT of this problem.  I roughly compared the Olympus and Maximal batteries side by side.  If there is any difference in length it is very small but apparently enough to cause an issue.I imagine the problems with the battery having no power seen here in a few negative reviews could be from a lesser degree of the same issue, where the power connection is flawed during use or charging so one suspects the thing is no good.The work-around is to build up the end of the battery with tape or something, though such a fix could make switching batteries a real pain given the tight clearances in the battery compartment.I decided to exchange the battery and hope the replacement meets the original spec. better.  I'm encouraged by it's vast majority of 4 and 5 Star reviews.  The battery was provided by Amazon and I managed to discover the problem within Amazon's Return Window so at least the return is going smoothly, supposedly with no extra cost to me for shipping the battery back and receiving it's replacement.The replacement arrived and has the same problem.  Using several layers of scotch tape, I built up the battery end where the tiny clip holds it in the camera.  The battery seems to work fine now while still slipping in and out of the camera easily.The package has a Support number to call.  The person I spoke with didn't know of any problems like mine and recommended I return the battery to Amazon AGAIN and ...get this... TRY AN DIFFERENT BRAND.  AND though it also is marketed for other manufacturer's cameras, this replacement is SUPPOSED to be an EXACT match for the Olympus model my camera takes...It even has the same Model Code on the package (LI42B).Subsequently I was looking at replacements for a Canon NB-6L battery and saw many 1 Star ratings for MaximalPower's NB-6L battery noting that the thing was TOO BIG to fit, although otherwise that battery also has a high rating."}], "B001D7REIK": [{"review_id": "88cc839298f340dd6979784ee84c4030", "review": "I recently purchased this and use this to back up my pictures and as a USB hard drive for my Wii.

I'm confident this will fade with use. The gap inside the ear cup is roomy, and the circumaural padding is soft and comfortable. It seems to be covered in a microfiber of sorts which is pleasing to the touch, but do trap some more heat than may be comfortable. (I recommend removing these every hour or so, just to let your ears breathe a bit.) They headset can expand to accommodate what I can only imagine to be heads of cartoonish proportions, so sizing should not be an issue at all. The mic slides out and can bend a bit for suitable placement.The Look:Aesthetically, they're damn cool. Matte black with a translucent red color scheme, the hideaway mic...it looks good, undeniably so. The square cups give it a vaguely futuristic look, which may be a plus for some. Frankly, it makes little difference to me, but there it is anyway.The Sound:The bass is a bit flat at first listen, but not to a point where it makes a listening experience any less enjoyable. It handles voice very well, on both counts. People sound fine on say, skype or world of warcraft, and your voice is equally audible to people on the receiving end.The Build:The headset seems well made, from top to bottom. The cushions seem fairly durable, the plastic does not bend or stress in any way, the mic boom seems well built and the cord is fairly resilient. The in-line volume control and mute switch also seem to be well made, although the volume control seems a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4. Volume setting 2 seems to be more than adequate, at any rate. My only gripe is that the plugs are not color coded for mic and audio."}], "B001ELJER4": [{"review_id": "905de243991becdba0c365b595855452", "review": "Big complaint:  Garmin needs to trim the product line and concentrate on selling no more than 5 models at a time. It should discontinue the old models as soon as the new models come out.  And the model numbers are extremely confusing.  A model named 780 may actually be an older model and has fewer features than a 765T.  Many of those models differ by just a couple of features.The first unit I bought had a volume problem.  The sound occasionally went to inaudible levels on its own even when the volume was set to maximum (100%).  Then after a trip it would go back up to normal levels again.  Amazon exchanged that defective unit.The traffic rerouting feature really works.  On a stretch of freeway with highway construction, the routing function intelligently bypassed that section of the freeway using detours.  I love that feature.  I assume the feature is only as good as the accuracy of information relayed to the center that keeps track of traffic information.The lane assist feature has two modes: the photo-realistic mode and the highlighted lanes mode in the upper left corner of the screen.  The photo mode only works at a few major freeway interchanges in major metro areas, while the highlighted lanes mode works at a lot more places.  There is no need to press any button to activate either mode.  The photo-realistic screen just pops up for a few seconds on its own at the right moment.  Then it goes back to normal screen showing the highlighted lanes in the upper right corner of the screen when the critical moment is past.The FM broadcast feature works well. It broadcasts directions over the car radio, but I have to set the radio volume high to get decent volume.One big gripe, the turn announcements sometimes come too late, almost at the last minute.  Most of the long distance turn announcements come in three stages.  Example:  after you just finished a turn, it will immediately say, \"Drive 6 miles then turn right on Broadway\".  The second stage announcement is at either 0.1 miles or 0.2 miles: \"In 0.1 miles turn right on Broadway.\"  Sometimes the secondary stage will say: \"In 0.2 miles turn right on Broadway.\"  The third and last stage is at about 10 feet before the turn:  \"Turn right on Broadway.\"  The problem is that the second stage warning at 0.1 mile before the turn is essentially a last minute announcement that is frequently only useful if you're already in the correct lane because 0.1 mile is about a half block length before the turn.  If you had kept on driving for most of the 6 miles in the wrong lane, you'd likely have forgotten that you should be on the right lane to get ready for the right turn.  Having only 0.1 miles of warning to change lane is sometimes very hard to do in busy city driving.Another major flaw is the unit gets very hot on hot summer days when it's plugged in and placed on the dashboard.  I use the bean bag mount on the dash and the unit gets very hot under the sun even when I am driving with the windows down.  The sun's rays heat it up, along with the fact that the electronics inside heats up on its own when plugged in.  The high temp is very bad for the longevity of the unit.  I may have to either build a sun shield or put white tape on the back of the unit to reflect sun light to keep it cool.  I would not be surprised if the some of the reports of premature malfunction mentioned by other reviewers and of the volume problem I mentioned earlier were due to heat damage.The \"Where Am I\" feature is great, particularly if you're almost out of gas and need the GPS to lead you to the nearest gas station fast.  It also shows the nearest police station and hospital.  It also tells you the nearest intersection and nearest street address, useful if your car breaks down in unfamiliar places and you need to call for emergency service.The MP3 player has about 2GB of free storage space. It can put out the sound in one of three modes:  internal speaker, earphone jack, or over the radio using the FM signal.  I didn't appreciate how nice it was having the MP3 feature until I realized that it's integrated with the GPS function, something that would not be true with your car radio. With GPS units that don't have MP3, one usually can't play music on the radio when the GPS is in operation(at least not loudly) because the radio would drown out the direction announcements from the GPS.  With the built-in MP3 on the 765T, I can play a whole album of MP3 songs while the unit operates in the GPS mode.  The driving directions announcements will override the music, so when it announces directions, the music stops temporarily and will resume once the direction announcements are over.  Very nice!Overall I love this unit.  Is it worth the premium over a 255W or 265T?  That depends on how much you value the lane assist and traffic info features and the MP3 feature.  I don't have Bluetooth devices and so can't comment on it. The lifetime (i.e. for the life of the unit, not of the buyer) Navteq traffic info subscription is worth $50 + the traffic antenna about $35.  So mostly the price difference between the 255/265 and the 765 is for the traffic feature, plus the MP3, bluetooth, lane assist, etc.  Are they worth the $100-$120 price difference?  I would tend to say so."}], "B001ELK2NY": [{"review_id": "7362c798b3d7ec7b98caee8f36fbca78", "review": "This speaker is horrible.

Recently purchased an I Pad 2 and my son loaned me a pair of  unnamed earbuds. All  I can see is a S on the end of each bud. I was surprised  at how good they sound.My family owns an  iMac, Mac Pro Book, two iPhones and four IPods. Also own one hellava home  theater system. High end Harman Kardon AVR coupled to a Klipsch RF 7  horn loaded speaker system in a 7.1 configuration, Oppo Blu Ray hooked up to a top of the line 50 inch Panasonic Plasma. The Klipsch 12 inch sub literally shakes the pics on the wall. You can feel the bass in the pit of your belly.All that that being said is just to establish I know a little about music and the potential of how it can sound comng from quality equipment. My musical taste are wide, but at heart I am a  R & B purest loving great and funky bass lines. I just opened and hooked the Sennheiser CX  300 II buds up to my IPad II.First impression is they don't sound any better than the buds  my son loaned me. What is annoying so far is they are itching my inner ear canal.  The other buds don't do that.  I just switched them out to recheck again they definitely itch, not a good thing. I do detect an improvement in bass and the tremble is too shrill. I can see ear fatigue coming already. I understand music is recorded across a broad spectrum using various techniques. When you factor in the time span of my music collection, late 1960s until now, one can see it takes versatility to handleball of the content. I can attest that while the music is playing you cannot hear anything outside. My wife was watching a DVD and I could not hear a sound. In fact the bass sound waves fooled me because I could feel them in my belly, but I could not hear anything.I am well aware of burn in as my Klipsch speaker system required it and indeed over time they sounded better. I hope this is the same with these buds. I am not saying they are bad buds at all. I am saying the verdict is still out. At the price point $24, Idon' t see a mistake. Time will tell and I will report my findings as objectively as I can................................................................................................................................................................................................................As promised have had time for burn in and yes they needed several hours of play time to do that. With that said I am a R&B; fanatic. I love the bass runs in great R & B songs. These buds expose the  imperfections  in older recordings. However they handle the newer recorded music wonderfully. Listening to Michael McDonald's, I Second That Emotion is a treat. The bass is deep and clean, the midrange is good also. On the Temptations, Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Jamerisons bass licks are clean, but this is an old recording and these buds reveal the limitations of the equipment.I will definately purchase another pair of this brand."}, {"review_id": "cf412df602283e107e4fb4ee85169ce3", "review": "I have had these buds for about 2 years and they are still my favorite.  I am not an audiophile by any means, but I can tell the difference between crappy sound and good sound.  These buds have great range no matter what kind of music you listen to (depending on the file bit rate, obviously).  The bass is nice and deep and the treble resonates without being annoying no matter what volumne.  I also have a pair of Beats by Dre and in a year I have already popped my left monitor.  But the CX300 are still blastin' and I use them at a minimum of 40 hours a week.

I've played with equalizers and bass heavy music and you can reach a deep low that the headphones manage really well.The length of the left ear cord is half the length of the right ear cord. This is to wrap the right ear cord around the back of your neck and keep the whole cord running down only one side of your body. I personally like this feature, but it's worth mentioning if you don't want that difference and would prefer equal length cords.These headphones come with a small carrying case that I use daily. It's a nice touch to throw in with the purchase. I think it helps prevent my headphones from becoming too tangled in my pocket.Bottom line: I use these headphones daily and they sound fantastic."}], "B001F0RPGG": [{"review_id": "e18ad922a383fdead96c1e6aeb2d4f89", "review": "I wrote this review at the Escort site but they won't publish it. All I have seen are mostly positive reviews for this product. However, my experience is different:First use - First ticketDrove I-75 From Orlando to Atlanta and back. Just decided to use new 9500ix for the trip in a car. I originally picked up the unit for use on a motorcycle. On the way it picked up traffic light cameras as well as K Band and regular radar. I noticed a number of patrol cars parked in plain sight on the center median perpendicular to the traffic lanes. Thought it kind of funny that I never had a peep from the detector for one of these cars. On the way back I found out why. Bingo a speeding ticket and never heard any type of warning from the detector. Laser!!! This thing does not pick it up. I'm sure it a good unit for conventional Radar but that is becoming obsolete. I would wait and buy a unit that is designed for the new wave of laser that will be in wide spread use and will replace Radar in the near future. Unfortunately, while the company claims that the unit offers some protection against laser I have not had it make any sound or warning whatsoever. So, I have to give the product an F.It seems like more and more law enforcement are going to laser. This is old school technology. It may work ok for regular radar and has a lot of bells and whistles some which you have to pay added subscription charges for. However most are not worth the money and I would have to consider this unit way overpriced.In retrospect, I should have bought a cheaper radar detector, and waited for a good laser/radar detector in this price range. The 9500ix cost way too much for what it offers. In a year it will be as obsolete as a land line phone"}], "B001F51G16": [{"review_id": "3735933b154823d4e611e7ce69078431", "review": "Just wanted to write this review to warn those looking to use this keyboard for gaming.  Purchased this keyboard at a major retail store yesterday and immediately returned it.  This is an excellent keyboard, the design is elegant, the keys feel very nice,the backlighting is nice and its truly whisper-quiet.  However, this keyboard has one MAJOR flaw that makes it not usable for gaming.  The keyboard has a feature that is supposed to help with typing mistakes, and it basically only allows for 2 simultaneous key presses at once for most keys...if there is a 3rd key pressed it does not take that input.This is a show stopper for gaming because one critical combination does not work: you can't press the Spacebar key while pressing a letter key and shift.  So basically in FPS games, you cannot jump while sprinting.  In practice this feels completely debilitating.  I immediately noticed the flaw in BF3, and tried it with other games (including Skryim) and can confirm that its an issue.  I checked reviews on Newegg and many reviewers mentioned the same flaw.So if you're looking to use this keyboard for anything other than gaming, I would highly recommend it.  However it just can't be used for gaming as you can't press mutliple keys at once.

I also like how it has the shutter button, AE-L/FE-L button, and front and rear dials as well as directional buttons to control the menus while the camera is vertical.I honestly did not know if it would be a fully compatible grip for that price but I was pleasantly surprised.

It really gives your camera a professional look."}, {"review_id": "d33af182b59b0796dfb3c80f7f2a78ad", "review": "Note:  I had initial problems with the device which now appear to be operator error.  Read \"Update\" at the bottom of this article.Fit and finish is great.  Fits on my D700 without issue and looks like it was made for it.  Controls work fine.  The Zeikos has a rubberized finish where you would grip it for portrait shots, which looks and feels just like the rubber on the D700.  Ergonomically it's very nice.  My only ergonomic issue is not with the grip, it's with the camera strap which tends to obscure the viewfinder when you turn the camera vertically.  But this would be an issue with the MB-D10 also.The holder for the EN-EL3 is flimsy; be very careful inserting and removing the battery in the plastic holder.  I don't know if it's possible to buy the holder separately if it breaks.  I don't want to find out.When using the AA battery pack, the Nikon D700 will fire at its maximum frame rate, which it won't do with the EN-EL3.  This is why I bought the product as I take a lot of action shots.The problem is, after using the AA battery pack for a few minutes, the D700 will throw an error and refuse to fire.  I get the same results using fresh non-rechargeables and freshly charged rechargeables.  So far I've been able to fix the issue by turning off the camera, removing the battery pack, removing the camera's battery, wait a few seconds, then reinsert the camera battery.  I had read that this product can fry your camera's electronics, which I believe is FUD by those who want to sell you the much more expensive Nikon MB-D10.  But it is disturbing that the camera errors when using the AA adapter.  I have not yet had an error when using the EN-EL3.This feature (using AA batteries and getting the faster cycle time) was highly desired but doesn't appear to be working.  Had this worked, the product would have gotten a higher score.I've heard that this grip will work with the en-el4a, but the cost of the battery (plus cover and battery charger) is so prohibitive that I've declined to do the experiment.Update:I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I'd change it to 5 stars if Zeikos releases an en-el4 end cap that exactly fits the grip.  (See below.)As mentioned in a reply to this article, I got it working with the AA battery pack by changing a setting in the camera.  You have to tell the camera what kind of AA batteries are in the grip.  I'm currently using Sony 2500 mAh \"CycleEnergy\" rechargeables, and they work fine, at the full 8 fps of which the D700 is capable.  I take action shots at horse shows, usually 700 -- 800 shots per show, mostly at full continuous speed, and a fully charged set of AAs will lose just one bar off the power meter after a day of shooting.  I've also noticed that the Sonys keep their charge at least as long as the Nikon batteries do.  I always charge up before a pro shoot, but for casual use I don't bother, and the batteries don't appreciably lose charge sitting in the bag.After four months of hard use, I've had absolutely no problems with this grip.  The rubber coating has not peeled off, there are no cracks or other stress signs, and the grip still attaches solidly to the camera.  I've used it handheld and mounted on a tripod with no problems.  It's been so convenient that I leave it on the camera.  (Which tells me I should have gotten a D3s instead of a D700 but that's another story.)I did finally spring for the en-el4 battery pack and the official Nikon endcap.  The battery pack works fine in the grip.  As others have noticed, the official Nikon end cap for the en-el4 does not fit exactly right on the grip.  There's a small gap in one spot.  It doesn't affect operation, and it's nowhere near your hand, but I would be concerned about weather sealing.  I'll use it in dry weather but will probably go back to the Zeikos battery pack when I have to shoot in inclement weather.  It's too bad Zeikos doesn't make an end cap that fits properly on this grip.  I'd buy one.I haven't done a lot of shooting yet with the en-el4, but a few tests show that I still get full continuous speed and the camera works flawlessly.Second update:I've owned this device 18 months now.  I thought I'd be taking it on and off the camera depending on whether I needed the vertical shutter, extra battery capacity or faster frame rate.  In practice, I keep the grip on the camera all the time.  It gives the camera a more solid feel, and I use the vertical controls a lot more than I thought I would.I now have two EN-EL4a batteries, and have had no problems using them in the grip.  I keep the AA adapter in my bag in case of emergency, but haven't needed in a long time.I shoot mostly action in outdoor settings, and my camera tends to see hard use.  The D700 has scars from being dropped, has part of the paint rubbed off from use, and the rubber on the body is starting to peel away in one spot.  You'd think this Chinese made knock-off grip would look even worse, but it is so far showing no significant signs of wear.  The rubber is still firmly attached, nothing has rubbed off with use and all the controls still work.I was a little anxious about buying this because of rumors that it would \"fry your camera\" or wouldn't hold up to field work, but I now have to admit, this is probably the best sixty bucks I have spent in a long time.  Here's hoping Zeikos manages to keep up this level of quality.Third update:I've had this grip for two years now.  It's rarely off the camera, and has seen heavy use with Nikon EN-EL4 battery packs.  (About 20,000 clicks during this time.)  It has taken a lot of abuse, including falling out of the car, and still works fine.  The only oddity I have noticed is that rarely (about five times in six months) the shutter release on the grip will stop working.  I *think* this happens when I swap batteries, but I haven't characterized the problem yet, mostly because it happens so rarely.  Turning the camera off, waiting a few seconds, and turning it back on, solves the problem.  My current theory is that it happens when I forget to turn off the power when swapping batteries, but don't know for sure yet.  Will update again if I find the root cause.I'm still really happy with this product.  I shoot in portrait mode a lot, and the vertical grip is very comfortable.  The build quality is excellent."}], "B001G5ZTLS": [{"review_id": "57fc5682b67c5f5110e71642882c232f", "review": "If you are a canon user with a significant investment in L-Glass from previous crop bodies, you will want to consider getting this camera or the next iteration of it. This is a full frame camera that provides great resolution for awesome cropping or wide angle shots. Although the current AF system is old, it is still very good. You will need to make sure your glass and body are at their optimum calibration as it is possible that even new out of the box to be slightly off. The factory will calibrate any Canon products within the first year for free. I suggest that you take them up on the deal. The only cost is your shipping to them. They are fast and good at what they do. Be aware that every lens can be off in either direction from zero being a front or back focussing issue. The body itself can be off, so do make sure the setup is right before doing any comparisons. All EOS models now offer micro adjustments to limit the need for sending out for calibration if you don't have the ability to part with your equipment for a few days.The 5D Mark II takes stunning crisp photos. I've tested with 24-70 2.8L USM, 70-200 2.8L USM, 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.8 with very good results. The HD video is a bonus. The lack of autofocus is not the worst trade off. The option to take clips of video when needed is nice though.If you are on the fence about brand to choose and have not invested to much in one brand or another, do look into both Nikon, and Canon for the best options for you. The extra focus points are really nifty on the d700, but the lack of resolution and HD video option on the canon side is a big plus. Those moving up from existing Canon Digitals will appreciate the faster and more accurate focus that comes with all 9 points being in focus with hidden focus point assisting the crisp focus to the corners. I'm very pleased with this model and the options for indoor and outdoor shooting. ISO is so good that 3200 is better than 1600 on my 50D.  The only issues I've had are with the slower continuous shooting FPS, and the flimsy shutter sound that does not inspire confidence in comparison to my 50D's fast and bold thuds. Ironically, the 5D2's capable of locking on to the targets in low light even with a delayed shutter will capture action more reliably than the 50D. I shoot a lot of indoor night shots in poorly lit gyms that the 5D2 outshines the 50D on the keeper rate with the identical lenses. The 50D has become my outdoor maximum reach tool. Even then the crops from the 5D2's are better. Its just the case where I carry the contrasting distance lenses to avoid missing shots altogether.A great camera that is up there with the really high end SLR's with a much lower entry level. Glass is still expensive but you can keep that for ever if you take care of it.Edit:After several years of pure magic from this camera and replacing the 50D with a 7D. The 7D is the next best thing to the 5D2 when the 5D3 is not an economical addition to your gear. The 5D2 has an incredible ISO range with such great image clarity, even with action shots in less than perfect lighting. Shooting side by side with the 7D has me wishing I just had 2 5D2's. This camera is the most affordable professional Full Frame camera on the market. It is still that great after all these years. Lenses go up in price, while bodies come down in price. Always get the glass first."}, {"review_id": "e4cd6aed3d1d4d39dbf31581d7e83a2a", "review": "I am SOO glad I own this productUpdate Aug 2011...

When I went to pick it up Canon replaced the shutter and board restoring the camera to like new condition. It would have been fair to bill me more than 1000 for these repairs since the camera was well used and 1 year past the warranty but they didn't. The gentleman explained that by looking at the camera it was obvious it was not dropped or exposed to abuse and because it was a computer issue they would extend this courtesy. THANKS Canon,  I am a LOYAL customer for life.  Makes me feel great about the over 10k investment in your product!  Nice to see a big corporate company look out for their customers.Since the original purchase 2 years ago I have purchased a 2nd 5D, and 6 prime lenses. I was curious if this would be a passing phase but it was not.  I have gotten a lot of pleasure from this camera and continue to do so.The Canon Mark ll 5D is EXCEPTIONAL, anyone who says the 21.1 MP is overkill is underestimating the ability of cropping wildlife photos to the smallest part taken at a far distance.  I can still find sharpness in the smallest possible section of the focused part of a photo. It really is incredible; the vivid monitor's sharpness tells the whole story without dumping the large files onto a laptop. The edge of a ruffled bird's feather, the sunlight on the corner of a leave is still noticeable and sharp with 21.1 MP. Because you can \"double check\" the sharpness prior to snapping the photo using the LCD, you are saving yourself lots of editing (and space, the files are huge) on the computer. This instantly makes you a better photographer and frees up more time taking pictures instead of editing them. Also, if you manage to take fewer photos but better ones, this can make the extra space for these larger 21.1 MP pics (about 28mb)  on your computer's hard drive about a draw.I used for the first time a 100-400 IS lens and after 10 minutes of practice have taken better photos than ever before. The 180 Macro lens takes pictures like a microscope capturing the infinite details of nature hidden from the human eye. Adding the 21.1 MP factor makes your possibilities practically unlimited. If you do not use L series lenses or better, and do not have the budget for these lenses, wait and do not buy this... you will only be torturing yourself by not having them, they are a must have. It would be like driving a Ferrari on rims.Because the AF (auto focus) mode adjusts so many functions including the ISO, an amateur like me can enjoy taking photos while not being concerned about the settings I promised myself I would learn. I just can't put the camera down long enough to read up on it! As promised this camera is excellent in very low light with the noise factor eliminated or greatly reduced. Amazing the way the 5D picks up light at night, just amazing. Once you take pictures at night with this camera, no other camera will do.Also, for anyone wanting to learn more about this camera, (and really any other camera like it) Youtube \"Canon Mark ll 5D\" and you will find about 20 knowledgeable videos of pros doing hands on demonstrations, comparing similar models, and offering priceless tips about functions you never knew the camera had. This, along with Amazon's testimonials proved invaluable in my decision to buy. If you would like to see the manual ahead of time visit Canons website [...]I was initially concerned that the camera may be a little complicated since I moved directly to this higher end camera after using the smaller Canon SD cameras and snapping pics with my friends Rebel 300d. The 5D is quite simple and once you use it, you will be hooked.I also recommend a Hyperdrive, a hand held device up to 160 GIG (about twice as heavy as an iphone and a little thicker) that you can quickly dump the photos from a memory card onto. This will save you money on buying multiple memory cards and lugging around a heavy laptop on weekend trips, after all you can use the freed up space and less weight in your backpack for more lenses.Battery life is impressive and it seems you can do over 900 pics on one charge with LCD and probably 2 or 3 times as much without it.I tried to talk myself into a lower cost camera with less mega pixels. I wanted to say I would get a regular HD video camera that had more performance features later. I relented and ponied up for the 5D and realized that for me personally it was worth the extra bucks. Very nice LCD screen and HD video in one unit. Hopefully this will delay my desire for a better camera and after seeing the impressive resale value of used L series lenses, surprisingly close to cost of new (I bought all used Lenses on Craigslist that look new) and the cameras, I felt the investment would offer future returns I could not pass up. I am very happy I did and am guilt free.Love It!"}], "B001G5ZTPY": [{"review_id": "c58a64d47786488bdb0f13ceccbc7f59", "review": "Let's get something straight from the beginning.  I don't care if you spend $[...] or $[...] for a digital camera, none of them are perfect.  It is like the surfer roaming the world looking for the perfect wave, it just doesn't exist.  Some waves and some cameras are closer then others but none are perfect.  With that said, the G10 is closer.I have been shooting digital for 10+ years.  That makes me a bit of a dinosaur.  I have been in love with photography and camera equipment for 50+ years.  I expect that in the next 10 years the technology will get better and the G10's successor will handle noise better then this model.  Until that happens, I will shoot at no higher then 400iso (in film days that was very fast) and use Nik Define 2.0 to get rid of the noise.I was going to give the G10 a 4 but raised it to a 5 based on a comparison with other P+S cams rather then trying to compare it with a DSLR.  This camera is at the top of the heap of the P+S (along with 1 or 2 others).  If you are serious about photography and want a camera that is capable (capable is the operative word)in the right hands of someone who knows how to take a photograph (not a picture), the G10 is a great tool.The lens is very sharp.  The resolution is excellent.  The colors are great.  I won't discuss the negatives.  They are obvious and apparent from other reviews.  I do know that if you accept the limitations of the this P+S cam and you learn to live with them and/or work around them, you will enjoy an excellent camera that does have the feel of the old film rangefinders.

I was able to set this up to control my TV, cable box, roku, and even a PC attached to my machine (with a wireless usb pc remote control mouse purchased separately).  My complaint though, is that a couple of buttons are already not functioning, after only a few months.  One of those is one of the device buttons, for the DVD device, where I had programmed the Roku.  So I moved that to the Aud decive button, and now I have a 6 component remote.  More annoying was the up channel button now isn't working.  OK, so I reprogrammed the fav button just above that to act as a channel up.  Hard to give more than 3 stars though, given these issues, though the design and features are nice.  It also was some trouble to program for the Roku; it would be much better if there were a preset for this.  Since I have the Roku 2 XS, which ships with a bluetooth remote, I had to purchase the basic remote from Roku just to have something to program this with.Aside from that, no real complaints.  Some of the buttons are a little tough to read in lower light, basically black buttons with greyish text.  But the back light button takes care of that, lighting up that text in bright red.

We also have two smaller HT setups downstairs in an exercise room and a hobby room.  We enjoy occasional upgrades or component changes so universal remotes are very important accessories. After years of frustration with the buggy and difficult-to-program Harmony series of remotes, I checked with an HT professional on something better. This is what he recommended.  We now have five of these; three upstairs (for convenience) and two downstairs. We have had them in service for about four years and I can highly recommend them. They are built to last, very well designed, powerful and flexible yet easy to program.  I have yet to find a device or component that cannot be controlled in every conceivable way. These remotes are easy to program but I recommend keeping notes so that it's easy to come back later to tweak (improve) the programming later after using it for a while.  I would also recommend avoiding the &#34;punch through&#34; feature unless you have a very simple setup.  The problem with the punch through feature is that you have to give up full control of the device you are punching through.  It is a trade-off for convenience versus control.  One more tip: When the range or button responsiveness isn't quite right, try fresh batteries.  Battery life is very good but there is no battery life indicator and they continue to work somewhat on depleted batteries.

This is smaller and cools better, probably because it uses copper pipes instead of aluminum like the previous cooler. Fan noise is average, no different than the old fan. I have a big tower case so there is plenty of room for a large cooler like this. With a smaller more compact case you may want to check your clearance first. On the box it says it's 158.5mm tall, 120.0mm wide, 77.0mm deep.I like that the fan easily separates from the fins for cleaning, unlike my old cooler. It just clips on the side using no screws. Big plus for that design. You can put the fan on either side, but you want the air to flow in the same direction as your case fans.Comes with a variety of mounting hardware for different Intel and AMD CPUs. You can also position it to blow vertically or horizontally, depending on which way you want the air to flow. Although the mounting instructions are not that great at first glance, it did not take long to figure out what parts to use and how to use them. If this is your first time mounting a cooler, you don't need/want to overtighten the screws. Just snug will do nicely. You don't want to crack your motherboard and/or damage the internal wiring running by the screw holes. This isn't your car you are working on.I used Arctic Silver 5 instead of the included thermal paste. Go to Arctic's website for the correct way to apply it as it's different for each cpu type. My i7-920 is quad core so it calls for a side-to-side bead instead of a pea-sized drop in the middle. There are how-to videos and pics out there if this is your first time.SpeedFan 4.49 says my idle temp is 35C, and while running Prime95 it goes no higher than 61C. Intel says the absolute max i7 temp is 100C, which if ever reached, the software should shut everything down to protect the chip. Btw, they say it helps to 'burn in' the thermal paste by running Prime95 or whatever, as repeated heating and cooling actually makes the paste work better, but if you don't overclock then that's not really needed.I wanted to move to water cooling but read how some have leaked and the liquid destroyed very expensive video cards (seems they are always mounted below the cpu on a vertical motherboard). I have not heard if the cooler's manufacturers offer any kind of reimbursement for the damage, but who wants the hassle? I'm guessing the only way to avoid that is to lay the desktop on it's side where everything is hanging upside down from the motherboard. I'd rather have my tower case upright so I guess I'll stick to fans."}, {"review_id": "d4aa6b8d28af5b1ca6151c743ac7834a", "review": "I really like this fan with the low noise. it keeps everything cool.

Here's the basic rundown:* Pain-in-the-butt to install. For AMD it requires you to remove parts from your motherboard. It also requires access to the bottom/back of the motherboard, so make sure your case has a CPU access window!* Huge! It takes up a lot of space in your case. This thing is massive!* Loud. It's not a quiet cooling solution. It gets pretty loud. I've heard louder, but not many.* Effective cooling. While it's loud, big, and a pain to install, it does cool the CPU quite effectively and handles overclocking quite well.* Complete. Everything you need is in the box. You shouldn't need to get any extra parts.My opinion is that it's a good cooler with a lot of unfortunate negatives you'd expect for a CPU cooler of this kind. No, it's not as small, quiet, or efficient as liquid-cooling, but it's also less expensive and not as complex as liquid coolers.Advice: If you're on a budget but want to overclock, this is a good place to start.

Garmin can't include a proper printed manual?  Shame. They included plenty of color advertising brochures, cards, and such.No A/C adapter (optional extra) -- but you can use most any A/C to USB adapter.Even with latest map update, some new businesses in my area and a large development site not listed.Remarks:I just got my 855 and am quite happy with it.  I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no \"training\" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to \"Zoom In\" and \"Zoom Out\" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say \"Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant\" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and \"Go!\" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing.  Battery power is good (3-4 hours) and the ability to pop the unit out of the cradle and take with you to use on foot (think hiking, hunting, parks, large malls, etc.) and the  \"find my car\" feature are nice pluses.  The \"Where am I?\" is also a very easy and useful way to add locations to your favorites list.I'll come back and add more after I've had more time using the unit.

I'll do my best to answer those that I can. Thanks!]Comments:Found satellites and had good location within five minutes right out of the box in my family room.  Good receiver.Replaceable battery!  Can buy additional spares if needed (hiking, for example).VR works right off the bat - no \"training\" required.  Very accurate in my experience so far. (No VR system is perfect.)Free Voice Studio software allows you to record your own voice prompts!  I can see mischievous minds at work already. ;)Fast route calculations -- overall pretty snappy and accurateGood \"MyGarmin\" web site with lots of extras, FAQs and support info.Has jack for an external GPS antenna/receiver, though I doubt you'll ever need it.  Might be helpful in some trucks.On screen touch keyboard works well and is easy to use.Lets you easily create and save routes at home before your trip!  Some units I've had made this very difficult.  Very nice feature that is simple and easy to use.  Can save up to 10 Routes, each route can have multiple destinations and via points.  Shows you distance and time of travel for each route saved.  Very flexible.  The 855 will optimize routes so you visit destinations in the most efficient order.  Kudos, Garmin!Has on board HELPTips:-- Audio out/headphone jack provide an alternate way to get audio.  Can use external powered speakers, for example.  Many new cars have an audio in jack which will give better sound than via FM transmitter.  I tried using a cassette adapter (such as used to play mp3's via car radio) plugged into headphone/audio out jack and it worked very well.-- I tried various A/C USB chargers and all worked fine.  At first unit will go into \"PC connected\" mode, but if you wait 30 seconds or so, it will then switch to \"normal\" mode and you can use it as you normally would.  Will charge battery fine.  These chargers can be found for as little as $5 sometimes.-- You can press and hold battery icon to see more detailed information, such as per cent charged and even core temps. (Diagnostic display)-- I saw a tip somewhere online on how to adjust the internal mike gain to improve VR by decreasing the sensitivity to background noise.  Will update later on this,-- While at home, you can easily set/save the location in favorites as \"Home\" (Overcomes common problem of house number locations being a bit off, which affects all GPS units, by the way.)-- Amazon camera case (item No. ??? , insert link) fits this unit perfectly and has belt loop for easy carry. (Will update this info later.)-- Cancel VR button on remote works as \"back\" button on menus, too.-- Use 128 CBR mp3's (constant bit rate) for best results.-- Minimize background noises when using VR for best results.  (True with most VR gear.)-- After you do the map update, you still need to go to myGramin dashboard and check for the new software update.  Follow the instructions very carefully.  Takes awhile, but it works and will verify the update once done.-- You can fold a paper plate to make a bonnet to shield unit from sun (heat) ad make the display easier to read in bright sunlight (though I had no problems with this).  Heat may be causing some of the lockups others here have experienced.  (Punch holes and use rubber band to secure.)-  In cases where a city or street name can not be understood, use the 'spell' option in VR mode and spell the name.8/5/2010 Update:  Used this on a road trip this past weekend (200 miles) and it performed very well.  So I can verify a few more things:1)  Extremely fast recalculations if you deviate from the planned route.  So fast, you might not even notice it.  Fastest of any unit I have used.2)  Very fast satellite lock when you stop (i.e. turn off the car and GPS) and restart.  It will be ready before you are!3)  I used the VR extensively and it worked very, very well.  I had no problems even with the radio on (low) and some noise in the car.  Yes, a sharp or loud background noise might cause you to have to repeat a command now and then, but this actually happened only rarely.  Most of the time, it simply worked.  I have not seen any other GPS with VR this good and this complete (in terms of supported functions).  This was the most important feature for me and I am very pleased with it.  You can truly use this GPS hands free nearly all of the time.  And most importantly, *all* the functions you need while driving are supported. (Like zooming, accessing turn info, searching for POI's and so on.)4)  This trip was one I have taken many times, so I know the various routes pretty well.  I like to drive down one way and come back a different way.  On the way back, it found a new, faster route on a tricky section.  At first, I thought it was misdirecting me, but when I checked and then followed the new route, it was indeed a bit shorter/faster than the way I normally go and on as good or better roads.5)  The estimated arrival times were right on the money.6)  I used the built-in speakers most of the time and they were loud enough for me.7)  Very easy to use, no problems or issues.  The only other GPS I've used this good cost twice as much.

I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice"}, {"review_id": "45fbc0e9980456250e353296b90fc74e", "review": "Camera arrived quickly and was easy to set up.

However, there were three things that I thought needed improvement: the keyboard, the screen, and storage. In each case, my thought was that they could be a bit larger (but not too large-after all, the main appeal of the EEE PC netbooks is their small size). The EEE PC 1000H provides those improvements and more-and for only a bit more than I paid for my first EEE PC.The main virtue of the EEE PC 1000 H is its small size and light weight. While it is larger than my 4G, it is considerably smaller and lighter than my iBook (dimensions and weight are given below). In practical terms, it fits easily into my rather over-stuffed backpack and does not add noticeably to its weight.  Naturally, if small size is of critical importance, Asus does make even smaller netbooks, such as the 4G and more recent versions.While small size is important, it is really not very useful to have a PC that is too small to use comfortably. While my 4G was quite usable, the 1000H is, from my standpoint, an ideal size. The keyboard is smaller than that of a typical laptop, but the key design and size allows for easy typing-much more so than the 4G. With the 4G I tended to just use one finger typing. With the 1000h I can type normally. The screen is also larger, allowing for easier viewing of documents. Of course, with a height of only 600 it does still impose some limits. I found the screen to be high quality-sharp and responsive. There is also a VGA output, in case you want to attach it to an external monitor.My 4G had a 4 GB SSD drive while my 1000H has a 160 GB HD. The downside of the standard hard drive is that it has moving parts and is a bit slower in booting up relative to the SSD. On the plus side, it has far greater capacity. The 4GB on the 4G was enough for the Linux OS and the base applications, but I had to rely on SD cards and USB keys for extra storage. The 1000H does have the SD reader and plenty of USB ports, but it has considerable storage space. Oddly, the hard drive is partitioned and mounts as two volumes (there are are also hidden volumes as well).While I did not buy a netbook for speed, my 1000H is quite responsive, even running Windows XP. I did not try any recent games, but it runs Starcraft and Diablo II just fine. Microsoft Office was also quite snappy. Overall, most users will find it quite adequate for their needs. Obviously, if you ant to play the latest games or edit video, you will want a laptop with more power. But, it does give a lot of power for the cost.For a low price netbook, it does pack in quite a few extras that you'd expect to only see on something a bit higher up the food chain. These include ethernet, multiple USB 2.0 ports, wireless N, and bluetooth. Everything worked well-it connected to my wireless N network without a hitch. I'm not a big fan of Bluetooth, but it is nice to have that option.It ships with fairly minimal software-mostly just the OS, some very basic utilities and a trial of Office 2007. I actually see this a plus-I hate pulling crapware off my PC and would rather have a nice, clean system. I did consider installing Ubuntu, but decided to stick with XP so I could run Office, Starcraft, Diablo II, and my windows based grading program. Yes, I could probably get everything going in WINE, but I decided to just keep things simple. Besides, my 4G is running Linux.Asus claims that the battery will last for 9.5 hours. I haven't put that to the test, but it is nice to have long battery life. After all, the main point of getting a netbook is so you can easily have it with you. Good battery life is part of this.Mine came with a basic soft case, but I bought a more robust one. If you plan to toss yours into a backpack or travel with it, I'd suggest a case upgrade.Overall, the 1000H is an excellent little machine. If you are looking for a travel laptop, an inexpensive laptop, or one to use at school, this is a great choice. I plan to use mine for both travel (once I can travel again) and at school. My backpack always seems to be packed with notes, student papers, records, my lunch, a water bottle and various other things-so small and light netbook is ideal. I did like my 4G a great deal, but it was just a bit too small for typing and easily entering grades. Hence, I mainly just used it when traveling. But, the 1000H is as comfortable to use as a normal laptop and hence I plan to get much more use from it.So, should you get one? My experience has been that most people tend to over buy when it comes to laptops. That is, they get a machine that far exceeds their needs. After all, surfing the web, doing an email and doing word processing do not take that much power. The 1000H provides more than enough power to do all that and at a very low price (well under $400). Naturally, I'd suggest trying one in person to see if you like the keyboard and screen size; but I think that most people will rather like this machine."}], "B001RB24S2": [{"review_id": "617424133ddb4d262d10ba0face96b0f", "review": "The cushion on these things is MASSIVE and soft.

Once you add a touch of EQ in the right bands (not just boosting treble, but also reducing some of the problem bands) these headphones turn from $50 headthumpers into cans that will rival rigs three times the price.  See this review for a great guide to EQ-ing these: [...]  I applied approximately the same EQ levels to my PC soundcard and my Android device, and the results were dramatic to say the least - mids and highs shimmered, but the bass was strong, smooth and clear, with great articulation.Listening to \"Dear Prudence\" by The Beatles, when you apply the correct EQ settings, everything just *pops*.  You can actually make out individual voices in the harmonies and backing vocals, something my heretofore mediocre headphones never could manage.  Of course, if you want these to thump, thump they will, but I'd still recommend to EQ them, just pushing the bass frequencies up a bit.  Don't push everything to max, tho - play around with the values to see what matches your preference.Overall, best set of headphones I've owned, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to spend less than $50 on phones."}], "B001S2PPT0": [{"review_id": "778d6724fb873f9acee0c59ee4993951", "review": "I learned photography back in the early 1970's on a 35 mm film SLR with a 50mm f1.8 prime lens.  In my opinion, a standard prime lens is the very best way to learn photography and is a welcome addition to any photographer's lens collection.This little gem of a lens from Nikon has to be their best \"bang for the buck\" in their entire catalog.  It is extremely sharp and fast and a pleasure to use.  Putting this lens on my D3100 has made that camera come alive.  It is significantly sharper, faster and better built than the kit 18-55 lens.  Images taken with this lens are sharper right out of the camera than images that have been post-processed with the kit lens.  Also, I am a natural light shooter and this lens is fantastic in natural light.I was lucky to get this lens for $199 from Amazon as it has been in short supply/high demand recently.  However, after shooting with this amazing lens, I would have gladly paid more for it.Bottom line - I will be keeping this lens on my camera the majority of the time, it is that good.  I highly recommend you get one of these little gems!Update:  I have been using this wonderful lens for 20 months and am even more impressed with it now than I was when I wrote the initial review.  Producing incredibly sharp images and incredibly shallow depth of field, this lens is my first choice for making artistic photographs.

Plus, the f/1.8 max aperture is very fast and useful."}, {"review_id": "b8eead8efa51ade476e930254a6b49ce", "review": "Have a Nikon DX DSLR?  Then you need this lens in your collection.  Period.  Don't debate it any longer, just do it.This is a wonderful little lens that will give you levels of sharpness, color, and image quality that will blow most consumer (non-f2.8) zooms out of the water.  If all you've ever used are f3.5-fwhatever zoom lenses, you're in for a real treat with this lens.  AF is as fast as any other Nikkor AF-S lens, and the fast f1.8 grabs shots in low light that will blow your mind.Of course, it's just a fixed 35mm.  A prime.  So if you've fallen into 'composure-apathy' that can come from owning a zoom lens, you're going to have to use to learn to to use your feet and actually think about composure a bit.  You've got to walk.  Get close.  Step back.  Think. Compose. Shoot.  It's more work, but the rewards can be magnificent.Lenses are tools.  'Kit' zooms are like a good folding pocket knife; a set of little screwdrivers, a couple of knives, maybe a saw, maybe some scissors, a nail file, etc.  Nice little tools that can come in handy in many situations.  Throw it in your pocket and go.  But when you need a good screwdriver to remove a stubborn screw, or you need to chop down a tree, or remove the engine from a '67 Mustang, that pocket knife isn't the best choice.  A prime lens is like a perfectly weighted and well-made single-purpose tool.  A solid screwdriver.  A perfectly balanced pair of pliers.  A well-engineered ratchet.  It's simple, it's basic, and it's a joy to use.And that's the simple elegance to using a prime lens.Lenses like this and the 50mm f1.8 are small and light.  They barely add anything to the weight and bulk of just the camera body itself, especially if it's a higher-level Nikkor DSLR (D90, D300s).  It's just effortless.  Compared to some of the heavier zooms (16-85, 18-105, 18-200), it'll make your camera feel weightless.  Fantastic for all-day wandering-around photography, assuming you don't need serious wide-angle or serious telephoto.However, this lens is a 'gateway drug'.  It and the 50mm f1.8 both fall into this category.  The low price and amazing IQ hooks you.  ;-)  Use it for a while, and you'll begin to want *all* of your glass to be fast f2.8 (or better), rather than the slow 'consumer' level variable aperture lenses.  And that can quickly become an expensive proposition. :)"}], "B001S4OTS6": [{"review_id": "8b9f2fbb8a337bfd2b3ccb7009afcdfd", "review": "I'm the ripe old age of 28 and grew up with computers - from the Apple II's used at my elementary school (mainly for Oregon Trail) to the slew of Windows based PCs I've used ever since. Always at the forefront of computer-human relations has been the keyboard and mouse (at least in my lifetime). It's no surprise then to see just how many companies try year after year to perfect this interface.Microsoft's effort with the Wireless Desktop 3000 is a noble effort worthy of praise.So in a nutshell here is what I like:Keyboard:+ Very stylish looking.+ A subtle contour that feels just right when typing.+ They keys are a cross between a standard desktop and a laptop keyboard. The keys make a satisfying \"click-clap\" when typing.+ WIRELESS! Say goodbye to those messy wires and hello to a clean desktop!+ 2 extra USB ports freed up (thanks to the wonders of wireless technology)!+ Integrated wrist-rest made from a soft-rubbery type of material.+ Plenty of integrated and customizable shortcuts to everything from email, calculator and multi-media functions.Mouse:+ Again stylish looking - I'm a sucker for Blue LED's of any type!+ Rubberized grips on the sides of the mouse are very comfortable.+ Integrated \"back\" & \"forward\" buttons are placed perfectly.+ Scroll wheel is heavy and super-smooth.+ Clicking the scroll wheel brings up a super-cool way to switch between apps - think Alt+Tab but better looking.+ The BlueTrack technology in the mouse is supposed to work on just about anything but glass or mirrored surfaces. In my experience this is true - except of course I can't throw away my mouse pad just yet as I have a glass-top desk.There are a few things that I don't like:Keyboard:- The \"function\" keys are small and evenly spaced across the top of the keyboard. This makes finding a specific 'Fx' key challenging.- No back-lighting whatsoever - obviously to save power but still.- Installing the included software does add more functions but takes an absurd amount of time for install - think more than 15 minutes! This is a keyboard and mouse not anti-virus software!I was a bit worried when I read that this combo operates in the 2.4GHz spectrum. I run a wireless network in my home and can pick up 6 different networks in my area. My fears of interruptions have thus far been unfounded. Everything works swimmingly! The keyboard and mouse each take 2 'AA' batteries and I've been using the same rechargeable batteries in mine for the past 2 months without a hiccup. According to Microsoft I should be able to squeeze out 12 months out of my batteries - we'll see."}, {"review_id": "9d2a2078970dfbb2791bcad9c311560e", "review": "I bought it at Sam's.  Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).  However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000"}, {"review_id": "44ba89f05030485c2fd38898fe4956d1", "review": "Got this at Office depot for $40.

Playing with the incredibly small Canon SD780 for a few days, it's a good time to take a step back and recognize the amazing technology which has come to us through the digital revolution. There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed in a shirt pocket, including taking high def VIDEOS! Decent pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Amazing. Also, Canon listen to customer feedback; their menus and interfaces are simpler and cleaner than some of the other makers. Finally, the price is really very low for the sophistication that goes into one of these babies - the equivalent of about forty bucks in 1970's dollars when the first compact cameras hit the market at much higher prices.There is only one downside - this camera is so small, and the sensor is so small, that 12MP is too many for top picture quality. I would have voted for fewer pixels, 8 MP instead of 12MP - and get lower noise in return. The exposure sometimes leaves blownout highlights. If absolute image quality is your top priority, there may be other Canon's to look at. But if you're not that picky, the results are excellent. The video function works well and I use it all the time since I find a short movie (a few seconds) is a better remembrance of an event than a still photo.

It is not terrible at all, but a couple items were real dealbreakers for me:1) Low volume level on DVD and Blu-Ray playbackThis must be something specific to LG. I have an LG DVR (LRM-519) that is a few years old and it has the exact same problem. When I play Blu-Ray discs or regular DVDs, I have to turn the volume on my TV or Sony AV Receiver way, way up just to hear the movie at a normal level. I was watching Baby Mama and had to crank my Receiver up to the max volume just to hear it. It is connected with an optical cable, but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI. I previously had my Xbox 360 connected to my AV Receiver and DVDs sounded amazing. I didn't have to turn up the receiver past 45 to get it really booming. With the LG BD 370, I had to crank it at 70 (max).2) The player uses the same remote IR commands as my LG DVRVery few other people will probably run into this problem, but the BD 370 happens to use the same remote control commands as my existing LG DVR. So, for example, when I turn on the BD 370, the DVR also turns on. When I press the Open/Close button on the remote, the DVD tray on both my DVR and Blu-Ray player open. When I press Menu on the remote, it brings up the menu on my DVR and my blu-ray player. This was just an annoyance at first until I realized that watching netflix or a bluray disc on the BD 370 could actually cause me to stop something from recording on my DVR due to the random command being sent to the DVR as I control the blu-ray player.3) Netflix only shows Instant QueueI admit, this is a very minor gripe, but I really got spoiled by the Netflix experience on my Xbox 360. On the xbox 360, the netflix menu shows not only the movies you have added to your instant queue, but also lets you browse a selection of shows/movies in other categories. I have found that I use that feature a lot. So I was pretty disappointed to see that it isn't replicated on the BD 370. However, the quality of the streaming on the BD 370 was every bit as good as on the Xbox 360. Also, I had zero problems connecting to netflix when I hooked up the player. I just connected the player to my router with an ethernet cable and it had no problem getting on netflix.Pro - The ability to watch Youtube on the BD 370 was cool, especially because it allowed me to log into my Youtube account and access my favorites. However, that was not enough to make me want to keep the player.All in all, if you don't mind the low volume level and you don't have any other LG DVD players or DVRs connected to the same TV as the BD 370, it is a pretty decent unit."}], "B001UQ6F5M": [{"review_id": "23146ade6b9a920934568f26562113d3", "review": "I picked this unit for the Netflix. Wireless configuration was a breeze. Was using Netflix in just a few minutes. Netflix works extremely well. Seemless kick ask video performance. It also offers Vudu. Didn't know what this was so I gave Vudu a try. Kick ask. I didn't know HD could be streamed over the internet so well. Movies look great on Vudu and so easy to use through the BD390. When I show Vudu to other people I get confused looks. \"Your Blu-ray player is going on the internet? Huh.\"I was not impressed with the music playing via the USB port. There is no shuffle; not even within a single folder. And then when you get to the end of the last file in a folder, instead of continuing to play the first file on the next folder, it just stops. Not kick ask. Lame. I can fit my entire music collection on a 4 GB USB stick, so I intend to use the BD390 to listen to music with the USB and not use CDs. These limitations on USB play back are lame.I have to hand it to blu-ray player makers on how much stuff they are jamming into these small and afforable boxes. There are billions of formats (both audio and video) and media types to deal with. Really amazing. But you know, I once bought a $49 DVD player that could remember the stopped position of the last 5 DVDs played. So if you ejected the DVD and then re-inserted it, it could continue playing where you left off. I have yet to see a blu-ray player offer this feature, but near the climax of DVD player feature advancement, many DVDs offered this feature. This is a very usefull feature if disk switching occurs before finishing them. So to some degree, I'm poo-pooing all blu-ray players until I see this commonly available DVD feature on blu-ray players. Skip the non-kick ask BD Live. I can really care less about BD Live, but I'm sure thousands of hours of engineering development went into it.-- Begin Update 11/29/2009 --I just realized the BD390 can remember the stopped position of blu-rays even if you eject the disc. The manual is very unclear about this feature. Manual seems to indicate it does not work for all discs. Only tried with one disc, so don't know how many stop positions it can store. The $49 DVD player refered to above could store five.-- End Update 11/29/2009 ---- Begin Update 12/10/2009 --OK, the assessment of whether the BD390 can remember the stopped position is still unclear. I have had several disks now that don't even remember their stopped position even if you do not eject the disk. So, in other words, I'm leaving the disk in, but just stopping play and powering down the BD390. When I power the BD390 back up, the disk left in starts back up with the trailers and goes to menu. Not kick ask. I don't know why with the 11/29/2009 update above it remembered the position with that disk and other do not. When I did the test on 11/29, I did not power down the unit; just ejected and reloaded. With the last few disks, even if eject and reload without powering down, they still don't remember stopped position. So it seems the functionality is hit and miss here. I'm hoping LG sees this as a problem and offers a firmware update.-- End Update 12/10/2009 ---- Begin Update 6/2/2010 --It appears that LG has fixed the hit and miss problem of remembering the stop position of a disc. With the latest firmware update, the player remembers where a disc was left.-- End Update 6/2/2010 --The picture quality is great with the BD390. It is not clear from the marketing, but this blu-ray will upconvert DVDs to 1080p. DVDs look great. The BD390 can also output either 24 or 60 Hz video. If you intend to have the HDMI AND component video hooked up, then component video can only output 480i. Otherwise, if HDMI is not hooked up, component video can output 1080i. HDMI can of course output 1080p.The front display is not kick ask. No way to see the remaining time on a movie or even the duration of a movie through menu options. And when playing USB music, you have to have the TV on. You just cannot navigate the folders without looking at the TV. All you see is the time of play on the front display. I think they could have managed to get the display to show folder and file information on the display. My car stereo can do it. Take away a few thousand hours of development on BD Live and improve the display on the unit. Also, MP3 files only show the file name on TV. It does not read the MP3 metadata tag information, which is really better for getting the artist and song title.One thing that is really kick ask is how the BD390 does firmware updates. You may say, \"Who cares.\" Well you should. How long do you expect to keep your BD390? Do you really think Netflix Watch Instantly will remain the same service in the next five years or so? Will Vudu even still be in business? Well, interfaces to these services will evolve over time. New services could become available. The BD390 will need firmware updates to keep up. If you have ever done a firmware update on a non-internet enabled blu-ray player, you know it is a pain in the ask. You have to download from the internet the updated firmware, burn to a CD, then insert in player and turn unit on. The BD390 checks for updates when you turn it on. If it determines there are updates, it asks you if you want to do the update. It then goes on the internet, downloads the new firmware, and then installs it. Very painless. Totally kick ask.So I have nit-picked a bit, but over all, the BD390 is kick ask. Netflix is just awesome.-- Begin Update 12/16/2009 --I have since down graded my rating to 4 stars. This Blu-ray player has since locked up twice. Once when doing stuff with the set up menus. Another time when just turning the TV on while it was playing music. When you turn on the TV, something goes on with the HDMI. Somehow this caused it to freeze and I had to shut it off and turn it back on. Combined with the hit and miss stop position memory (which is a defect in my opinion since it is inconsistent), and now these freezes, I cannot justify a five star rating anymore.-- End Update 12/16/2009  --"}], "B001V9KG0I": [{"review_id": "cf335371e17f5b6518d3f0e046edb215", "review": "I bought this case for a Canon comact camera (one of the newer ones, don't recall the model number) and it works well.

They sit differently then any other headphones iv had and even running on my readmill they have yet to fall out of my ear. I also got them on sale for 55$ due to them being open box from a Vendor on amazon so that was key in buying them also.

I'm a cross fit / weightlifter who listens to all music, but primarily hip-hop / R&B; during workouts, running, cycling, etc. I was in a debacle trying to determine whether to get these S4s or the Bose IE2 (StayHear tips).  I've heard reviews claiming that each one is better, so I initially bought the Klipsch, then decided to try the Bose.  Here's what I found:PROS:- Overall the sound is great, the highs are good, mids are decent, bass is just OK --- not impressive (which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5), I'd say the sound is better than the IE2s.- Noise-cancelling - when I put these in, I don't want to hear any other sounds (e.g., the gym, other people, noise, etc), I want to be submersed in my own world.  For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING.  When I tried the IE2's, I couldn't concentrate on my workout as I still heard normal noises, chatting, weights dropping, the A/C, etc.  For this reason alone, I am selling my 5 day old IE2's for a loss.CONS:- Bass is not impressive, it's just decent.  My old Sony's had better bass.- Although it comes with 3 sizes, the silicone is just a bit awkward and doesn't fit in my ear securely, so i sometime have to adjust it while running or doing other activities. In this regard, the Bose StayHear tips would must betterHope this helps."}, {"review_id": "48b234c4910c89bdfd03ae1e08b0e2f2", "review": "Reading many of the reviews on here, they recommended to use these headphones for at the very least 24 hours straight before giving them good field use. Turns out, they're all correct.When I first bought the Image S4's at a local best buy, they sounded \"pretty\" good out of the box, but they also sounded pretty painful in certain frequency ranges -- in the treble most notably. \"S\" and \"ch\" sounds in lyrics would punch my ears in the face and make me wince. Songs had a certain shrilling tinny quality to it, that was definitely not comfortable. Well, I left the S4's on my desk plugged into my Zune HD overnight, playing music at random. About 18 hours later, I can already hear a massive appreciable difference in the sound quality. The treble has softened back to a beautiful balance with the mids, no more shrilling pain from lyrics, and the bass has solidly found its place without trying to overpower the whole track. At lower volumes, the bass, mids, and treble are easily audible and full -- which was not the case before, where the bass would drop out, and the treble would overpower the mids.My opinion on the S4's went from \"If things don't improve, I will return them,\" to \"FOUND A KEEPER HERE.\" -- And that's only with about a three-quarters of a day worth of burn-in! Most people recommend at least two to three days worth of burn-in to get the truly wonderful sound these headphones are capable of producing. I'm interested to see just how much they'll get from here in the coming hours.Elsewhere, the S4's fit my ears superbly. The oval tips on the buds fit perfectly into my canals. I don't get any discomfort from the build of pressure as I push them in -- the design seems to allow excess air to escape very well. This also means that then I put them in, I've yet to hear the speaker \"crinkle.\" The other nice part about the oval design is that if I pull the muscles around my ear to make my ear stretch upward, the seal on the buds are not lost, which always happened on my old Lenntek Sonix. I would have preferred to have seen a braided cord on these, and the buds made from milled aluminum billets to really add some durability value to these, but they're quality isn't lacking as-is. The cord feels a bit thin, (not weak, just thin,) but at least klipsch added some of the best stress-relief shielding I've seen on a pair of buds. You won't see your cable weaken and drop signal on these for a long, long time -- if ever.I've trusted Klipsch before to impress me with my choice of desktop / entertainment center speakers, so when it was time to get new headphones, I thought I would place trust on them again -- and sure enough I'm not disappointed."}, {"review_id": "4c7517c9bafbdbbc75cd70b819155067", "review": "I ordered a pair of these for my dad and I about 6 months ago. My dad loves his old music and didn't think headphones were a big deal until he got these from me for x-mas. I think I accidentally turned him into a bit of an audiophile lol. As for myself, I love these things.The quality is truly amazing. The bass is VERY clean even at very high levels and not overwhelming by any means. The mids and highs are very very nice as well. You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device. I even tried these out on my FiiO e10 amp/dac and they are even more amazing!I've listened to other earbuds and found these are the best suited for me at a decent price. I can wear these all day long for days on end and not even notice them being in. By far the most comfortable I have ever had. Another great point is the noise cancelling. There is this fat redneck piece of crap that rides in the back of the bus that never ever shuts up with the most annoying girlish cackle that puts you into an instant rage when wanting to sleep. These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke! It annoys me to no end to see people buying that garbage just because it's signed by an uneducated rapper. :\\ I've had a lot of earbuds to know those things don't even compare to the cheapest plastic ear ripping garbage out there. My coworkers I ride the bus with (very long ride every day ugh) are so brainwashed thinking they can somehow justify that massive price they paid. I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past. Of course the quality isn't quite at audiophile levels but for the price, they are beyond exceptional.

While the control capabilities is nice (in theory), the sound quality, durability, and actual ability to control playback makes me happy I bought these well below retail price.As far as sound quality, I would place these in the realm of $20-$30 Skullcandy earbuds. They produce absolutely no bass with any music, and podcasts sound extremely tinny. The drivers are so light that I realized out of the box these would not impress. I have used higher priced Klipsch before, and these had none of the full sound previous pairs had. I am currently using Bose IE2 earbuds as well, and moving back and forth from the Bose to these it surprises me how much cleaner the Bose sound.The build quality is also lacking. I would qualify the build as better than cheap Skullcandy earbuds, but I expect these to shred apart in less than 6 months after careful use. The shielding around the wires is thin, and the connection point to the buds feel like they will either loosen too much or the shielding will wear away at the bud contact points. The \"remote\" portion is not as solidly built as can be, but the one control button has a good click to it. Overall a cheap feel.The actual fit is not bad at all. There are multiple tips, so one is bound to fit properly, and they do a decent job of isolating sound from a tight seal in the ear.The actual control of an Android phone (Droid Incredible 2) is spotty. The app to fully utilize these has a decent amount of setup options for only having one button to use. Sometimes the earbuds control spot on, sometimes I accidentally hang up on a phone call by mistake. There seems to be noticeable lag or non-responsiveness with button presses at times, and was verified to work the in the same spotty nature on a Galaxy Nexus as well. I would have loved a separate set of volume up/down buttons, instead of having to long hold the button to go from lowest volume to loudest without any accuracy. On a positive note, basic interface works on iPods/iPhones as well, with the ability to play/pause as well as start up voice control.Call quality is pretty impressive overall. People on the other end sound fine through the headset, although a bit hollow and distant sounding. I have been told after multiple calls that the quality of my voice through the microphone sounds good, even with me leaving the mic portion hang naturally from the cord without me holding it. The only negative about the mic is that is seems prone to pic up ambient noise as well as wind, but in a quieter indoor environment there were no issues.With a limited supply of controllable earbuds for Android, these may fit your need. They do work, but do not expect anything more than a passable experience and barely passable sound quality. The $99.99 asking price is outrageous.

I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the \"sweet spot\" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of \"small\" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried.

I'm sure I'll find a use for them."}, {"review_id": "601f02b133cba2b10d495658c0ef6aa4", "review": "I am still getting used to this speaker set, but for the price, it is great so far. No it is not like some super concert hall quality set, but for the price it really delivers. I have seen all the various reviews of people complaining of anemic performance(not about this product, but in general) and I always wonder what people expect out of a 2.1 system. For I would say 80% of one's general audio needs, this is a great buy. If you want to shake the pictures off the wall, then maybe go for another package.On a basic user level, I like this unit because all the controls are located on a remote that sits on the desktop. Having to reach under the desk to adjust the bass is not necessary. Also, the various inputs/outputs are located in the same remote. The only complaint I have is that ergonomically, the remote is a bit unbalanced in the various controls - the volume knob is huge and the base is a bit hidden on the side. But that is really small potatoes overall.Regarding the actual sound, it is fine for what it is. Decent bass, the highs and overall frequency balance is fine. As with most audio setups, if you do not have an equalizer on your computer, see about getting one. While this unit is ok in its flat response, it certainly can use some tweaking to get it just right.Overall - especially in terms of price to performance - this is an A+ product. If you are some crazy audiophile, you may not be completely impressed. But for the vast majority of users out there, this is a very affordable and effective computer audio solution."}, {"review_id": "3f86bc58e35cff29b9b3fd91a4efb248", "review": "I purchased two of these, one for my desktop computer the other for my downstairs TV.

I'm a music lover, and my great set of computer speakers with a subwoofer just lost its 'woofer after ten years.  As I unwrapped these amazingly low priced units, I wondered if I would be surprised or disappointed -- and I got a bit of both.The speakers are smaller than they look on the web site, but they don't have a small sound for my purposes, namely, listening to a wide range of music while working.  The midrange and bass are good.  But the high ends are completely disappointing.  Is that hole at the top of the speakers a tweeter or just a decoration?  Either way, the high ranges are lacking -- no crispness at all.The net result sounds like it does with water in my ears, or when your ears don't pop during an airplane landing.  There is no treble control to fix the high ends, though the bass control lets you set the 'woofer at whatever level you want.Fortunately, my computer sound card has an equalizer that lets you change the sound.  With one of the sound profiles (\"jazz\") the sound is tolerable, so I won't be sending these back.  At the price I paid, these will do until I spring for a replacement set -- maybe another cheap set recommended by others in this review section, or I'll just have to fork out more cash."}, {"review_id": "605f208309ff281235b68f7ba6eeacc7", "review": "I searched around on Amazon for quite a while and looked up reviews on several speakers all across the internet before finally making this purchase.  I had a set of Bose Companion 2 speakers, and they were nice, but I constantly felt the lack of a subwoofer was leaving me wanting more bass.  These speakers sound decent, but the speakers themselves have absolutely NO bass in them at all.  Thankfully, there is a subwoofer with this set.  On the control knob, you can adjust the speaker volume, the bass level, and there is a headphone jack and auxillery jack.  The speakers are pretty thin so they don't take up much space on my desk.  I have the subwoofer under my desk and so far everything seems to be working out okay.  They get up to a decent volume also.  If you are looking to not spend very much money, these will do the job for you.  If you are looking for absolutely awesome speakers, look elsewhere.

I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these."}, {"review_id": "547dab5982ae53c011f287179cfbe5d8", "review": "Any1 that's had bluetooth stereo headset knows how bad they sound and these are no exception.

U charge it every night, u should be fine.5: since it's bluetooth, it also has a crappy range, like 20 feet.If you know these things, then they're worth every penny."}], "B002C7481G": [{"review_id": "2250020231be36cc5c0277221a95370e", "review": "Before buying my iPad, I spent about an hour in the Apple store playing with it.  I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!Obviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10\" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?After owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on \"HD\" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a \"gamer\" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the \"magical\" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other \"killer app.\"  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called \"Atomic Web.\"  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13\".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The \"acase\" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes."}, {"review_id": "7f2a89de817d12124e8c1c32883dea74", "review": "So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a \"third device,\" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution."}, {"review_id": "13f099471d42822e945f7ec78dac3809", "review": "Hi,I am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ?

Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from \"internet disks\" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to \"internet disks\".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses \"tricks\" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings"}], "B002DP1FTU": [{"review_id": "d7afe16e7f34d5c975d5b535a200490a", "review": "Sources: iPhone5 with PA2V2/FiiO E07k/Decware Zen Head amps using the LOD, various computers using the Microstreamer/Beyer A200p/v-moda Verza DAC/amps.Review notes: My first impressions of the sound of the SRH440 are based on direct comparisons to other headphones - the v-moda M80 and M100, the Beyerdynamic DT1350 and T51p, the FAD Pandora IV and VI, and notes I've accumulated from many prior reviews. I describe how I relate to the SRH440 (i.e. my personal tastes and how I use the headphone) only after covering all of the objective issues.Summary of sound: It's no coincidence that the SRH440 has such a good soundstage and sense of openness, since those properties are highly dependent on a neutral frequency response that's free of peaks, recesses, and colorations which derive mainly from undamped resonances.My first impression of the SRH440 is neutral sound. But it's much better than that. In my 80-odd headphone reviews, I've used expressions like &#34;fairly neutral&#34; or &#34;basically neutral&#34; etc., but the number of those that I'd play with no EQ whatever were very few: B&W; P7, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, FAD Pandora VI, Mad Dog, Sennheiser IE800, and the Shure SRH1840. Compared to those six, the SRH440 gets close to the Mad Dog and the IE800, and has a better signature I think than the other four. In the case of the P7 and Pandora VI, their responses are slightly more 'V'-shaped, but still fine for most genres as is. The Custom One Pro and the SRH1840 are a bit more bland, but also fine for most music genres. The SRH440's (understandable) limitation is its ultimate resolution - the most expensive headphones I've listed here have a subtly clearer sound that's noticeable in direct comparisons, but when the SRH440 is heard on its own, I doubt that very many users would hear the sound as any less than perfect.Some concerns I have with low-cost headphones are inconsistencies in matching the sound between the left and right drivers, and matching the sound between different production samples of the same headphone. When there are any such inconsistencies, a customer may experience a very different sound than what they were expecting based on reviews they've read. Although the SRH440 is only $99 USD currently, every indication I have is for a high quality well-made product. The limitations I notice most compared to the more expensive headphones are the fit and finish - the finish is plain and plastic, but elegant in its simplicity. The earcup fit doesn't feel as though it's making a good seal to my head, which is usually critical for proper bass response, but since the bass is just right anyway, the only issue with the fit is that it's not as luxurious as with the pricier headphones. The SRH440 earpads are quite good, and are a huge step up in quality from (for example) the Sennheiser HD280 Pro earpads.Earcup rotation is no more than a few degrees horizontally. Vertical rotation is 180 degrees, so from the earcup rotations I'd expect the SRH440 to fit a wide range of head sizes. My average-size head fits with the earcups pulled out to click stop no. 4, allowing a 3/4 inch smaller and 5/4 inch larger adjustment to the headband on each side. The long coiled cable is single-entry to the left earcup, and has a proprietary detachable locking connector with a 2.5 mm stereo plug (same as other Shure headphones). The cable is terminated with a standard 3.5 mm miniplug threaded for a 6.35 mm plug adapter (included). A soft plastic carry bag is also included.The comments in the music tracks listed in this review can be compared to other headphone reviews I've done, to get an idea of how the SRH440 plays the different music tracks listed here compared to other headphones. My suggestion is instead of reading each comment below as an absolute unto itself, you could compare these notes to other reviews as they get posted, and see how the SRH440 compares with each individual track.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has excellent detail and tone with a modest weight, and both male and female vocals sound natural without favoring either. The SRH440 plays this extremely well.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled perfectly by the SRH440.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound. Of special note here are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement. Those impacts are soft and well in the background, but you can feel some of the weight they carry with the SRH440.Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Classic Rock): Very good instrumental detail and the vocal sounds very natural. As with most classic rock tracks, there is very little or no deep bass. The SRH440 plays this music smoothly, and the lack of deep bass doesn't unbalance the treble.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled extremely well by the SRH440.Cantus - Danny Boy (Traditional/Male Choral/Acapella): The SRH440 plays the voices with enough low end warmth and weight to sound very natural, yet there is no added emphasis of the lower register of the male voices on this track.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRH440 reproduces the space and detail convincingly.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the SRH440 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Pop/Rock): The SRH440 plays this high treble energy recording very smoothly - the voice and instruments are detailed but not sharp or edgy.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): This track has a good amount of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice is excellent and the tambourine sound has better than average tonality.David Hazeltine - Fur Elise (Jazz): A very high-quality recording from HDTracks. The SRH440 reproduces the instruments smoothly with a spacious ambiance. The wire-brush-on-cymbal harmonics are very extended and detailed.Grieg (Beecham-Royal Philharmonic) - Peer Gynt-Solveig's Lullaby (Classical): This very old (late 1950's) stereo recording must have been made on the most expensive gear in the world, since the overall sound quality and especially Ilse Hollweg's amazing voice are as close to &#34;being there&#34; as I've heard with some of the better classical recordings made since the year 2000. The SRH440 plays this music perfectly.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion in this track hits really hard, and the bass tones beginning around 0:45 have the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind of sound and feel that indicates a good deep-bass response. Overall, the SRH440 plays this music very well.Heaven 17 - Let Me Go (1980's New Wave/Techno): The bass instrument (guitar?) has very good detail, and the voices and ambiance have a &#34;you are there&#34; quality that's uncommon in early 1980's pop music. The SRH440 plays this track perfectly.Hugo Audiophile - 15-16 (Electronic): I'm not sure what the 15-16 stands for - perhaps track numbers from a CD album. The deep-bass tones that start around 33-34 seconds into the track reproduce extremely well with the SRH440. This is a great recording for evaluating whether a headphone's bass will be sufficient for most environments, since for many headphones that have a weaker bass, the deep bass gets absorbed and mostly lost when the environment contains a lot of low-frequency energy.Human League - Keep Feeling Fascination (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's bass line is very detailed, but the somewhat forward voices don't have quite the &#34;you are there&#34; quality of the Heaven 17 track noted above.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has several loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical with some headphones. The SRH440 provides excellent detail. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrument separation and detail, and the SRH440 does those exceptionally well.Kellogg Auditorium, Battle Creek Michigan, Aeolian-Skinner Organ (1933) - Pedal, 32', Resultant, Arpeggio: This 16 hz organ pedal tone differs from other music tones in that you won't &#34;hear&#34; the tone - you'll only feel it. Although most music tones have harmonics (including this one), the harmonics from this tone will be too weak to provide any &#34;feel&#34;, so whatever you actually hear would not be part of the fundamental 16 hz tone. There are ~30 hz sounds in the outdoor environment in big cities, generated by large trucks, buses, and subway trains, and they have a quality of &#34;rumble&#34; that's similar to some deep-bass tones found in music. This 16 hz organ tone is easily distinguished from those sounds when compared on a headphone that has good undistorted response at 16 hz. The SRH440 plays this very well.Mantovani - Sunrise Sunset (Easy Listening, ca. 1972): A master musician and conductor who specialized in light classics and orchestral pop music, Mantovani's accomplishments were overshadowed by music critics who couldn't tolerate the notion of &#34;light classics&#34; or &#34;semi-classical&#34; music, even when those recordings were no threat to the classical music genres. In any case the later Mantovani recordings from the mid-1960's through mid-1970's had the advantage of being mixed for much better hi-fi systems than those which the music critics possessed at the start of the Long Playing (LP) record cycle. Here in 2014, at least some of those digital remasters have improved the sound further, although it's not always the case. This track as played on the SRH440 is an excellent example of the sheer musicality lurking in those later recordings, and is highly recommended for soundstage, instrumental tone, and musical balance.Michael Tilson Thomas - Rhapsody In Blue (20th Century Classic): Great sound and soundstage, and terrific piano playing and tone. There are some very deep bass impacts starting around 38 seconds into the 17:24 length track, and the weight of those impacts is subtle but appreciable with the SRH440.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some nicely-detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are a series of &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRH440 reproduces those sounds very well.Richard Strauss (Mester-Pasadena) - Also Sprach Zarathustra (opening) (Classical): The granddaddy of bass is in the opening 1:50 of this recording, and I've heard it only once on a large and expensive loudspeaker system in Cleveland. For most people, that experience would be indistinguishable from being in a fairly strong earthquake. The SRH440 conveys as much of that experience as is possible on a more-or-less neutral headphone. The tympani also have good impact here.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRH440 renders the tones and transients very well.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are quite strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRH440 delivers the impacts with proper weight and detail, and the horns have the kind of bite that gives them a wonderfully realistic sound.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are fairly soft, and while the bass isn't very deep, it still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, works very well with this track."}], "B002DPUUKK": [{"review_id": "aebb0a58805def2c78c7a513bb3da776", "review": "The ergonomics are great.

I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.Hopefully it will last!"}, {"review_id": "2046e32c397805fbbfd6576bbc90ab0f", "review": "UPDATE Sept 15:  My original review was mainly positive but knocked off a star for some minor issues.  I got a replacement which fixed one problem but introduces another.  I'll insert comments into my original review.----I agree with almost everything said in the other positive reviews about the great ergonomics, the scroll wheel that you can toggle between hyperscrolling (very useful) and the more common measured/notched scrolling, the many useful features attached to the other buttons, the way you can use the mouse while the battery recharges, and the incredibly tiny receiver that works with other compatible devices.Maybe you're having trouble thinking of a way to justify spending $100 for a rodent.  I was too, but I thought of a way to justify it that maybe a few of you might find helpful:Before now, I'd never spent more than $30 on a mouse (except once, a $50 microsoft bluetooth mouse that doesn't work too well).  But I was never happy with any of them.  They were either uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, or stopped working after a while, or something.  So, after a few months, I'd give up and buy another one.  Over time, I spent probably $200 on a series of cheap mice.When the Performance MX came out a few weeks ago, I saw all the positive reviews (from users and from professional publications and websites), and it occurred to me that maybe if I spent more for a really good mouse, I'd be happy and wouldn't have to keep buying $30 mice every few months.As I said above, in most ways I think this is a great mouse and agree with the many other positive reviews.  But I've experienced some minor issues, too.1.  When you start pushing the mouse around after it's been sitting idle - even for just a few minutes - there's an annoying one- to two-second lag before the cursor reacts.  UPDATE Sept 15:  Logitech tech support figured out that this was a defect.  I got a replacement, and it's perfect.  With Amazon, I didn't have to pay shipping for the replacement, and I didn't have to return the first mouse until after receiving the replacement.  Very happy with Amazon's service.2.  At this time, the number of devices that are compatible with the unifying receiver is very small:  just two keyboards and three mice.  The unifying receiver would be far more valuable if there were more different types of compatible devices.  For example, I would like to see a numeric keypad and also a presentation/pointer that could work with the unifying receiver - logitech makes both such devices now, but they won't work with the unifying receiver.3.  I'm probably being too picky here, but I find the \"click\" to be a bit tinny, and louder and less satisfying than other mice I've used.  UPDATE Sept 15:  the replacement mouse is worse.  The left button makes the same tinny click when you press down, but when you let go it makes a louder sound, almost like a knock on a door.  (The right mouse button doesn't do this.  Go figure.)  This gets annoying after a while.  Sorry, but if I'm paying $100 for a mouse, I want it to be just about perfect.Since almost all the other reviews of this mouse are very positive, I am sure that my experience with two of them each having a minor but annoying defect is uncommon.  In absence of these apparently rare defects, this is a really great mouse."}, {"review_id": "85249e56c282987c1b3a36b1e4f03fd2", "review": "I've been living with this mouse for about a week.  I've used it for one day on my PC at work and the rest of the time at home on my Mac, running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.  In both Win and Mac OS, i had instant functionality when i plugged in the mouse.  The special buttons don't start working until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.Compared to my Apple Mighty Mouse, this thing is nice because it works the instant you turn on the mouse.  No waiting for bluetooth to sync with the computer, etc.  I installed the mouse drivers on both platforms and not surprisingly, they \"feel\" different.  For example, i like the simplicity and look of the the Mac version of the driver.  There is a BUT here though....  In the Win version, the forward/backward buttons can be easily set as... forward and backward buttons for a browser.  The Mac version has no such default, and i had to tell it to do a keystroke instead, which still accomplishes the same thing.  It's not a huge deal, but a pretty odd omission for something that should be rather obvious.  Not everyone out there knows the keyboard commands for forward/backward.  Wish they made this a bit more foolproof.The feel of the mouse is very good, but i have medium/large hands.  If you have small hands, this mouse will feel huge.  You might consider other Logitech products if that's the case.  It is a very ergonomic shape and i find it comfy.  I love the thumb rest/button.  They got this one right.  It's hard enough to press that it doesn't fire off accidentally, but also doesn't require tons of pressure to activate.  I use it on my Mac to do Expose, but it could be programmed to do anything.  The Windows version of the driver has an Expose-like feature, but it's not nearly as nice as the Mac OS version of it.  Perhaps Windows 7 will have cooler visuals.All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel.  The scrolling is fine, but does seem a bit clunky for a \"top shelf\" mouse such as this.  It feels clunky and sounds that way, too.  If you need a mouse that scrolls quietly, this isn't it.  My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department.  The middle button is what really blows on this mouse.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works.  Other times i feel like i'm going to break the mouse to get it to work.  For this reason, i reprogrammed the \"zoom\" button just below the forward/backward buttons to be my middle button.  I had no use for the zoom, so it works out well.  The zoom button has a great feel.  So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a crappy middle button, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything else i felt was well put together and seems to work well.  I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model.  It has other uses, which are probably not important to the vast majority of users.  Heck, on a Mac, Apple used to think ONE button was enough on a mouse.  Silly Steve....  I now have 7 buttons and it all works pretty darn well.I think most people will find this mouse very nice and probably worth the cost.  The new \"unifying receiver\" is just freaking tiny!  The receiver is smaller than the USB plug it's attached to.  It just disappears underneath my aluminum Apple keyboard.  Range on the receiver is good also.  I tested it about 8 feet away and it works flawlessly.  I also tested the mouse on glass.  Yes, it works and works well."}, {"review_id": "c4a53da106ef262b05565a0846cf70d2", "review": "After purchasing the Anywhere mouse (also Logitech) I was missing the feel of a larger mouse.

I like the rechargeable battery so you don't have to stock up on batteries.  Also, it comes with a Wall-to-USB adapter so you can charge the mouse in the wall if you don't have a USB slot available. It also works when plugged into the wall.The best bonus I wasn't even aware of is the screen toggle button located in the thumb area. It minimizes all the windows on screen into miniature and shows them all so you can switch your open windows with ease.I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone. IN fact I am buying a second one for my husband!"}, {"review_id": "2c9128c7ed47c9a67f409929cc4ea3ac", "review": "MOUSE: This is a very nice mouse.  It looks large and has an unusual shape, but I have at most medium size hands and it doesn't feel too big. The functionality is very good as a \"basic mouse\" with great laser control, etc.  Frankly I rarely remember to use the special side buttons to do things like previous/last windows in a browser.  It's still a very good, top end smooth mouse even with out using every possible bell and whistle.  I use a laptop a great deal and this is the first time I've really bothered to like a mouse enough to bring on a hotel trip.BATTERY:  I understand it has an extremely high quality or state-of-the-art brand of AA rechargeable battery.  In a pinch you can use any AA battery though.  I don't know how often it needs to be recharged - probably not more than every couple weeks.  It gives you a \"low battery\" warning - a little PC popup - which supposedly comes on intermittently for nine days as its charge gets low, suggesting the full life must be a few weeks if the last phase of low-charge, is nine days.  (Logitech experts note the prior Revolution mouse had a built in battery, which I assume would eventually get tired.)RECHARGING:  Recharging is trivial as you just plug the supplied, or any, microUSB cable into the front.  If you use a thin microUSB cable, even if you are computing during the charging phase, it is no more inconvenience than any good corded mouse.  It gives three nice progressive (rolling) green lights on the side as it charges, progress-bar style.  As far as I can tell there is no need to use the \"off\" button (I think it sleeps when not touched rather than running its battery down) but the instructions aren't clear.WIRELESS.  It works with a very tiny wireless dongle.  It doesn't come with much documentation but it stores a Mouse App in the system tray (lower right corner in Windows) which has a lot of information.  Supposedly, if you get into the Mouse App, there is a \"star\" symbol tab option which gets you into the \"Unifying Wireless\" app.  In the Mouse App, click \"star\" tab at left then click \"Open Unifying Software\" and it gives you instructions to connect with other Logitech devices (typically by turning them On and Off in the proper Unifying Software mode.)"}, {"review_id": "2a73100026f400b06c8969c74d09b7b8", "review": "This seemed like a great mouse from everything I read but in the end it hurt my hand.

I'm very happy with it so far.  I had purchased a new laptop recently with Linux Ubuntu installed.  After using the mouse pad for a while, I started to have pain in my wrist, so I decided to get an ergonomic mouse.  I was worried that I would have trouble using one with Ubuntu and have to return it, so I went to Staples, and the Performance MX is what they had.  On getting it home, I plugged in the wireless receiver to one of my laptop USB ports, turned on the mouse, and it worked immediately and has been working ever since.  No software installation necessary (although the \"zoom\" button doesn't work on my laptop--I probably need to install the software for that, or it might just be Ubuntu).I read some of the negative reviews of the Performance MX after purchasing it, and I can't say I have noticed any of the problems:the mouse is comfortable (although it could have been even bigger for my hands);the scrolling wheel works fine;the wireless connection works fine and does not cut out;the battery has not had to be recharged yet after 1 week;the Darkfield tech works great on my desk.While I am happy with it, it is not ideal:(1) The general construction feels sturdy, but the buttons feel like they might not last--especially the scroll wheel and the button that toggles the scroll wheel between smooth and \"ratcheting\" scrolling.  I find myself constantly babying the scroll wheel (which I use a lot--with my last mouse, my natural hand position at rest was with my index finger resting on the scroll wheel, but here I am conscious of trying not to touch it when not using it because it feels flimsy).  This doesn't mean it is actually flimsy or needs to be babied, it's just a psychological design thing, but that's important.(2) I paid $90+ for it, which makes me feel like somewhat of a sucker.  I don't understand why this mouse costs so much more than others."}, {"review_id": "3ac5bb5ae0d7601a7991b122ad36aa6c", "review": "(Update)This mouse suddenly started working for me after months of the frustrations I listed below. The cursor will flake out every once in a while but it's usable as a mouse at this point. I am still going to give it a low rating because the battery only lasts a few weeks at a time and this is unacceptable to me. If this doesn't bother you then you should buy the mouse today.(Original Review)I'm a pro photographer and my computer is as important as my camera. I work on a Mac and I was looking for a great mouse, Sadly this mouse is barely functional  on Adobe CS4 products if you are using new hardware and new software. For the folks working on older equipment I can't speak for them. The mouse software locks up my Adobe software mostly Lightroom and Photoshop, who do I bill for down time, my customer or Logitech, looks like my customers and I lose here. However InDesign does not seem to suffer. Apple Safari does not work if you want use the scroll wheel but it's still mostly functional. General use is very unpredictable, you will need to adjust to the mouse rather than making adjustments to suit your needs.A few positive remarks: The build quality is top notch and the mouse is more comfortable than anything else I've used for important tasks. A very nice feature is it uses a AA battery so you can toss a freshly recharged battery while you recharge the one that you used up. I typically get about 4 weeks per charge working 7 days a week.Save your money and wait for an update in a few years. Stick with Microsoft mice for now, even though they are a bit irritating they only cost $30 and that's $70 less irritating."}], "B002IKLJU0": [{"review_id": "69287ffbb7f75fe07a2214d26c6f5a05", "review": "It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time.

I wanted something a little smaller that still had a front pocket for extras such as an iPod, the laptop power cord, a small external hard drive, and a couple cables. This case was in my price range and is well reviewed. The very first review and a few others I read mentioned that this bag was a little small and potentially a tight fit. I have a Lenovo e420 14\" laptop and decided to buy the 16\" bag so I would have a little extra room.When the case arrived the first thing I noticed is the bag is very slim. My 14\" Lenovo e420 fits comfortably in the bag leaving a little extra room so it does not scrape the zipper. If I had gone with the 14\" bag I have no doubts that there would have been issues with the laptop rubbing on the zipper. I have enough extra room to put a manila folder with some paperwork in the pocket along with the laptop itself. The second/middle zipper has several pockets inside that are good for storing small things. In my case, some SD cards and thumb drives. In front of those small pockets there is room for the laptop power cord, a small usb external hard drive, my iPod Classic, and a couple small misc cables. With all those items it makes the pocket a little bulgy and doesn't leave much room for anything else. The very front zippered pocket on the bag is really tiny. I have a cellphone charger in it and that is a very snug fit by itself.Honestly had I known the bag was practically a notebook sleeve with a front pocket I probably would've opted for a different bag. That being said I'm going to use this one for awhile and see if it grows on me. I like that the bag is smaller than my old one and that its very lightweight material.

Many people may start comparing this product to the iPod touch, but there are many aspects of PMP (portable media player), including the price (you get 16GB for one-hundred-sixty dollars, where for an iPod, you get 8GB for two-hundred-twenty dollars), that make the Zune HD a better choice and a strong competitor with today's leading PMP's.||>>APPEARANCEWhen I first opened up my Zune box and took it out, I was amazed. The Zune is extremely light and durable. The brushed metal back to the Zune gives it an industrial, yet sleek look. And since the screen is OLED, you can barely see where the screen boundaries are on the device. Overall, this probably one of the best looking devices I've ever seen (and I've seen tons of PMP's).||>>EASE OF USEThe user interface is amazing. It's definitely the best UI I've seen in a while. On the whole screen, there are options for music, pictures, videos, podcasts, internet, marketplace, social, and settings. Each sub-menu after that is pretty much the same. For music, you can view the music by artists, albums, genres, or songs (just a list of the 500 songs or whatever). You can switch between these different viewing options by swiping it to the left or right. The Zune performs these actions flawlessly.||>>INTERNET BROWSERAlong with all the other features packed into this device, the Zune sports a great browser. According to some sources, the browser is a slightly modified version of Internet Explorer 6. It seems pretty outdated, but many of the websites I go to have a mobile version that works just as well. Overall, loading pages is sometimes fast, and sometimes slow. It really depends on wi-fi network you're on. I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the web browser in terms of scrolling, and typing in text (the on-screen keyboard is great). The only thing I wish the Zune had was YouTube support, but with all of the music I have, I can manage not going on YouTube.||>>PORTABILITYThis devices is extremely light. It weighs around 70 grams, while the iPhone 3GS weighs about 150 grams. The devices is about 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall, with a screen that's 3.25 inches diagonally. The perfect dimension make the Zune extremely easy to carry around with me wherever I go, and also perfect for holding in my hand. I recommend buying a case (Incipio Feather Case for Zune HD (Black)) for this device.||>>SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch. All my friends have iPods or iPhones, and even they say that my Zune sound quality blows theirs away. There are many different EQ settings for the music; acoustic, classical, electronic, hip hop, jazz, pop, and rock. I would probably say acoustic and pop are the most well-balanced options on the device, but different people have different ears. You might like different EQ settings, not to mention different headphones have different sound quality too.||>>BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on this device is a little bit better than the average PMP. With the brightness on low, wireless off, and the volume at 15 out of 30, I could probably get about 15 hours of battery life. The battery life also, depends on the bitrate of the movies or songs that you're listening to, as higher bitrates mean lower battery life. Most of my songs are 320 kbps, which is fairly high, so my battery life approximations may or may not be accurate.||>>SCREEN QUALITYThe OLED screen on this device is AMAZING. The resolution is 480x272, which isn't true HD resolution, but you can output HD video with the dock, which is sold separately. The colors on the screen are extremely bright and vivid, and the blacks are extremely dark. And the thing about OLED screens is that when they're displaying black pixels, the screen simply isn't being lit up at those pixels. So, having a lot of black really saves a lot of battery life, not to mention the whites look much, much better on OLED screens then any other screen. HOWEVER, if you're displaying a lot of white, the battery life drains a little faster than usual, which doesn't really matter that much because most of the menus are black anyway. If I was stuck on an island with nothing but my Zune HD and a couply of movies, I would be happy. :)||>>HEADPHONE QUALITYThe headphones that come with the device are pretty good. The only problem that I have with them is the bass response, so if you're an audiophile like myself, then you'll probably want to get new, better headphones. The headphones themselves are built extremely well and last a long time (longer than the generic Apple headphones). Also, the ear buds have little magnets on the ends of them which is kind of cool.||>>VERSATILITYThis device can play music, pictures, videos, podcasts (for free from the Zune Marketplace), browse the internet, download songs (and albums), and run some apps. So overall, this device has a pretty good range of things it can do. However, there isn't any integrated speaker, so you won't be able to watch videos or listen to music without headphones or separate speakers.||>>APPSThe apps selection is pretty limited. At the time of this review, there are probably only about 40-50 apps, most of which are simple 2D games. But they have a Facebook app, email app, and a twitter app, which I find quite useful at times.||>>SOFTWAREI've used iTunes before and I have to say, the Zune software totally blows iTunes out of the water. The interface is just so much faster. It looks nicer, instead of those bland Excel spreadsheets. When you're playing a song, the background automatically changes into a collage of different albums but that band, similar artists, artists photos, and some other stuff. Overall, the software is excellent, and really adds to the Zune experience.||>>MUSIC SUBSCRIPTIONS OPTIONSFor one-hundred-forty dollars a year, you can buy a Zune PASS. The Zune Pass is a subscription services that allows you to download an UNLIMITED amount of music for the time you're subscribed, along with 10 additional songs per month that you can keep forever. So, if you buy a 1-year subscription to the Zune Pass, you can download unlimited songs for a year, keep them on you computer, Zune, or Windows phone, and then listen to them whenever you want. Then, at the end of the subscription, you can download 120 of those songs to keep forever, even when you aren't subscribed. And if you stay subscribed, you can just continue like nothing ever happened, and then at the end of the 2 years, you can download 240 songs from the collection. Having the freedom to download as many songs as I want until my Zune gets full is really fun, and I would really recommend a Zune Pass to anyone who's thinking of getting a Zune.||>>VERDICTThe Zune HD is an excellent devices for anyone who wants a rich and filling digital media experience. The Zune might have some flaws, like not very many apps, and no YouTube support, but for the most part, the Zune shines. I would recommend this PMP over an iPod anyday. If you want tons of apps, and YouTube, you should probably consider getting an iPod, but if you want an amazing multimedia experience, be sure to consider getting a Zune.--Bob"}, {"review_id": "c7db64b14e19928507c27df326ca3f10", "review": "As an all out Zune owner, I have always enjoyed the devices and how they would update their devices with all the new features every year, including the old brick zunes.

You don't know how beautiful a video or picture can look on a small device until you look at it on the Zune HD. The black quality on the screen is amazing and the colors are so vivid. Some of the features on the device is really helped out by the beautiful screen that this device possesses.Graphics: With a stripped down version of the nVidia Tegra chip inside the device, you can not go wrong. It has 8 processors making the device working at its best. It will definitely help once 3D games come to the device. Can't wait for that to happen!!!Software and Marketplace: The Zune software is...nice, could be better, could be worse. I like that it is customizable unlike Itunes. The marketplace is pretty, it could definitely have more videos and movies, but lets not forget that they just started with movies when the Zune HD came out. Still, many of the TV shows that I have like watching on CBS and FOX are NOT on the Zune Marketplace, which disappoints me. This can be apart of the review because this is the only software that the Zune is compatible with. Yes, its only on PC, its so sad that people with Macs can't use it, that 5-10% that can just use boot camp to use it. I mean seriously Mac users, get over it, YOU CAN USE IT!!! I have always like the wireless sync feature just in case I just don't want to find my sync cord you can just bring up the software and on the device just click wireless sync. Podcasts are handled on the Zune software. The catalog of podcasts are not as big on Itunes, but that is not such a big deal. What is great about it is that you can choose how many that you want to keep on your computer, so it automatically deletes on the ones that get old or outdated. You can also choose which ones to automatically sync to the device. Whether it be all of them, or just the ones that haven't been played yet and the ones that get played on the device get deleted after you watch.Apps: No store here. People who want a device for apps, its not here. The Zune HD has a very few simple games and only 2 applications. Microsoft has promised that they will be adding more to the catalog eventually, but its not here. The games and apps that they already for the device are nice to have. I always the Texas Hold 'Em game, simple but nice. The newest update allows 3D gaming which is great. Audiosurf Tilt is simply amazing with the screen. They are all free, thats a plus, but the catch is there are short advertisements before the games come up. Thats not such a big deal if you can get all of their stuff for free. I would much rather, though, pay for a valuable app from other developers. Microsoft has to keep with the times and allow other developers to create their own apps. Once Microsoft actually reads something from their reviewers and listens to them, they might get somewhere even further.UI: Beautiful, Microsoft was really working to create an interface for a touch device. They did a beautiful job at doing so. The searching for media on the device is so easy and very quick to learn. I absolutely LOVE the sidebar on the main screen. You just click on the left side of the main screen and this other screen comes up with \"Pins\", which are basically songs, pics, or videos that you like you can pin to the side bar so you can quickly access that when you turn it on. The next feature on that screen is history, which shows everything that you have been doing on the device like songs that you just recently listened to, podcasts, or websites that you view on the web browser. The last feature on that screen is \"New\" which shows the newest things that you recently added to the device so if you just added a song to the device, just go to the history screen and you can easily play the song without going through any menus. You can also delete ANYTHING that you want off your device by just clicking on the item. I know that the Ipod Touch does this, just not with everything.Music and features: Sound playback has always been the best on the Zune. They decided to bring the basic EQ back to the device, which is nice...just not nice enough. A customizable EQ would be great. You don't even need an EQ if you have the Zune premium headphones, with both of them together, it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)! I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month. So if you compare it to Itunes...10 songs for $1.29, you spend $13 on 10 songs that you get to keep and that means you get unlimited streaming to millions of songs for just $2 a month. What a bargain!!! You also get the the Zune Pass with the On-device marketplace. You can download songs to the device right from the online device marketplace and even when you get offline, you can still continue listening to it. I love the zune pass and its definitely worth it if you love music.On-Device Markeplace - Very nice to have, especially if you have the Zune Pass. They also have the very few apps on the marketplace and you can download updates right from the marketplace, but there hasn't been any updates to the 7 games that Microsoft supplies.Pictures: Beautiful, scrolling to the next picture and rendering the picture from horizontal to landscape takes not time. It uses the same multi-touch feature to zoom and is quite useful. Overall...nice.Radio: This is one of Microsoft's selling points. This radio is FM AND HD radio. Too bad I don't live near any main radio station that include HD radio stations. I don't really see any improvements in the radio either. When I go to the city, I will let you guys know. What I have always loved about the radio is the tag to FM feature, which is when you get a clear enough reception, it will show the title of the radio station and the song that is playing currently. You can tag that song and add it to your cart which you can download with the marketplace. That is a great way to get introduced and familiar with new music.Social: Still evolving...not there yet. I am so sad that they took away the song and podcast sharing from zune to zune wirelessly. Its gone, now there is a way to send songs with an email address or zune tag (or xbox live gamertag) when you plug your zune back into the computer. What they did do is add your zune inbox if your account is synced with your device, and it displays on your device...which is nice. But it is still sad that they took away the wireless song sharing feature. (It still works with the older models if you still have one!)Internet browser: OK...not as good as the Ipod Touch safari browser. There is no flash...yet. But you get the choice to either use the internet browser as a mobile browser or you can view sites in their desktop format, its a choice in the internet settings menu. The keyboard is small, but isn't every PMP keyboard? The added auto-correct features with the new firmware update, but it is still not as good as safari.This was a complete and honest review. I love Zune and I have always thought about going back to Ipod, but Zune keeps coming out with new devices that can not be refused. Music and video playback and exploration...Zune is the one and only way to go. No other device does it as good as Zune. Applications and web browsing are better for the Ipod people. Unlimited streaming of music and keeping 10 songs a month, go Zune. Paying individual songs at $1.29 a month to keep forever, go with Ipod. There are so many things that I listed on here and probably a couple of other things that would affect your decision. But I hope that this helped.5/17 update...1. the newest zune update got rid of all of the advertisements before the apps started2. There are now around 20 apps for the HD including facebook and twitter...still nothing special. Let's just hope the the Windows 7 series phones apps will be compatible.3. CBS and FOX have both been added to the Zune Marketplace4. They have added the Smart DJ feature to the HD device (like Genius on the ipod, but actually gets better results)5. Direct Xvid compatibility...you don't know how much better that made this thing. Makes the Zune way more compatible that now you can directly add .avi files without converting first.6. Internet browser got better, faster tilt sensitivity and faster overall experience. You can take snapshots of what is on the screen while surfing and save it to the device in pictures."}, {"review_id": "e545a76c64eaa0aaacb157a4c5965d37", "review": "Ha, with a title like that I got your attention didn't I?  This is a review of the 16GB Zune HD.  You will not see a comparison or mention of any Apple product here.  I am a 39 year old male and this review is for the Zune HD and what it is like to OWN one so that others may decide if they want one.  First off, you will notice that this review is \"Amazon Verified\" - yes, I purchased the Zune from Amazon and waited a couple of weeks to actually USE the product before submitting a review of it unlike some of the others here.  Enjoy....Packaging:The Zune comes in a nice small black box that slides open to reveal the contents which are the Zune HD, headphones, USB cable and some paperwork.  It's very stylish and nice.  Not much else to say as the box has been tucked away ever since opening.The look and feel:Ever since the first time I saw pictures on the net of the Zune HD I have wanted one.  Being a previous owner of a couple of different MP3 players the Zune was a must have just for the looks alone.  It really has nice lines and the color is just right; black and silver.  I hate this new term \"sexy\" and cringe when I hear a guy say it about an electronic device.  It does describe the Zune but I won't call it that.  The weight is very nice and it feels good in your hand.  I love the modern look and if they ever turned this device into a phone I would by one in a heartbeat!  I sometimes hold it to my ear and think, \"WoW what a cool phone this would be.\"  The Zune logo on the back and a simple \"ZUNE\" on the front - very elegant.  On top is a power on button, the left side a volume rocker and the home button on the front.  The bottom is where you plug in your headphones and next to that is where the docking connector/USB cable plugs in.  It's the kind of device that has looks that will never get old and you want to just keep staring at it.  Very pleasing to have something you want everyone to see.The screen:OLED - it's the big talk these days.  I have a few pictures on my device right now and I have to say they look great.  The blacks are true blacks because the device shuts down the pixels where there should be black so you see true blacks and vibrant colors.  Outside I agree with most folks about the glare.  I have the brightness turned all the way up and it looks nice inside but outside the glare on the glass makes it as if you want to look at the reflection then back to what's on the screen.  I don't see this as a problem as I can't imagine any other electronic device no matter what it is not having this same problem.  For me, I can still see what is on the screen and have no problem with it.  It is just the right size at 3.3 inches.UI interface:Although inside the box there was no manual you would really have to be pretty stupid if you couldn't figure out how to navigate on this device.  Also, on the Zune web page is everything you need to know about how to work this device - who needs paper these days anyway???  The transitions from screen to screen are so fluid, smooth and animated.  The touch only needs to be light and it works flawlessly.  After using the device for a few minutes you get the idea of how to navigate.  You start off with a list of items to choose from on the main menu; pictures, music, apps, ect, etc.  As you click one you dive into that section and dive even deeper as you work what ever you have chosen clicking/touching away.  At all times the home button on the front will take you back to the main menu.  The accelerator zips from landscape to portrait very fast and smooth.  I really like that and feel the tegra chip inside is working for me without strain when I see this - video especially.  Multi touch works well and tapping is fine too especially on the web browser.  Everything is laid out nicely and there is no confusion about how to find something.  This is a plus for first timers and experienced users alike.Zune software: (APPS & Marketplace)This is a free download and helps you manage the Zune contents and updates.  The software mimics some of the icons on the Zune so you quickly identify the UI and what you need to click.  Syncing is a breeze and Zune will let you customize what content you want on the device and what you want Zune to do with it.  I have all of my MP3's in my music folder on my computer and it grabbed all of them when I plugged in for the first time with no problems.  There are some complaits about the software and how it takes forever to download - not true.  There are not a lot of apps right now.  I hope this blossoms as the months go by.  I have downloaded all of them so far as they are free but would gladly pay for any others if they should come about and would be useful.  The weather app is nice and lets you add as many cities as you want and shows you not only current conditions but a five day forecast as well.  The calculator well is a calculator.  The games have been just OK - I feel they do not utilize the Tegra chip but in the future I am sure the games will utilize the chip as it would be a waste if they didn't.  There is a chess game, Texas hold em, space ship shooter, a Bejeweled like game, soduku, and some game where you try to figure out where an item is hidden after mixing up three robots.  All are fun for a short while but I wait for more advanced cool games.  Also the games have ads just before they start - we are talking about 5 seconds of a video clip.  For a free download I think they have every right to put this here.  Also, FOUR to FIVE SECONDS is what we are talking about.  Is it that much time???  Patience!!!!  The marketplace is just something you need to experience.  Music, Videos, Podcasts and more.... EVERYTHING is here for you to choose from.  There is an option for a Zune pass and for $14.99 a month you can go nuts with this and download as much media as yo want - you get to keep 10 songs a month too.  This alone is worth buying the Zune HD.  There is so much content at the market place that I can't really explain.  Imagine walking into a store that has no one in it but you and the inventory consists of basically every kind of music you can think of as well as tons of other types of media just for you alone to walk up and down the isle to choose from.  I just hope for more apps in the future and (I know) this thing just came out so while I wait for apps I will enjoy my Zune....Docking station:I went with the basic Zune HD sync doc ($49) and lucked out with it.  There is an A/V dock you can purchase too($89).  I will tell you the only difference between the two is 1) the price and 2) the A/V doc comes with the HDMI and optical cables.  So if you already have these cables, which most of us do, save $40+ dollars and get the regular sync doc.  I have a review on the doc here on Amazon (where I purchased it) so check that out.  It is nice to just plug it in and sync and charge.  Also I can hook it up to a TV if I wanted or a receiver and utilize the Zune to transfer music and video to my home entertainment center.  The doc compliments the Zune and is very stylish looking and most importantly - Functional.Battery life:The OLED must be doing what it is supposed to do - save power.  I take the train every day to work from Milford, CT to Greenwich, CT and I can go about a week without charging using the Zune about an hour or so a day.  Wonderful! The only thing I have noticed is the back gets warm when in use.  Very strange.  I have been impressed with the battery and hope it stays that way.Screen protectors:I never had one before and at the time I received my Zune there was only Ghost Armor available.  I got one screen protector and had no problem putting it on but being a noob I didn't spray my fingers and my finger print was stuck on the adhesive side.  So I took it off.  Ghost armor was very nice and sent me a replacement but instead of just the screen protector they sent the full body armor - how nice of them!  This time around I was very careful and it went on with no problems BUT....I noticed the screen protector was about an eighth of an inch too short on top.  It was enough to bother me so I took it off.  (I know you are thinking I am nuts)  So I looked and found BodyGarudz on the net.  Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz's applicator solution wasn't as good as Ghosts and Ghost's squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it's even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn't use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven't bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care!"}, {"review_id": "4eb641da15cf5bbf3c38e2506f603d64", "review": "This is the best media player for the price. But when it comes to other features such as apps and the Zune software  used to load music/movies, this is where it is limited. I was looking for a cheaper replacement for my old ipod touch, which ran out of storage quite quickly, the Zune Hd was a near perfect fit. The lack of camera and built-in  speakers was disappointing, but the cool features and unique navigation really shined. The complete lack of apps in the app store was quite disturbing, only 50 or so apps, most of them pretty bland.Compared to the ipod, the Zune Hd has EXTREMELY fast start up times (5 to 8 seconds usually) , the battery is amazing and it hardly ever crashes.While the Zune Hd may be lacking some features,they are not deal breaking features, I still have to give the Zune 5 out of 5 stars. The build quality and quality for the price are amazing. This product surprised me in every way (except the crappy app selection)."}], "B002JQNXZC": [{"review_id": "5727c0274dc8538c7d6cf6cc0f0b486e", "review": "for $7 this powerful device holds other powerful devices (2.5 inch satas to be specific) and works like a charm. expect up to 30 mbps transfer with usb 2.0, and IF YOUR MOBO'S USB 3.0 IS BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE then the transfer rate with a 3.0 is faster.

The screw holes didn't quite line up, but went in fine.The whole thing feels nice and solid. I copied several megabytes of data to it, it worked perfectly, and seemed speedy. The case is nice and thick. There's a green LED by the USB jack that is on when connected, and flashing when data is being accessed. The pouch that comes with it feels like soft leather, and has stitched edges all the way around, and it's just big enough to fit the case and the USB Y-cord.The manual states that this case is limited to a 500 GB drive, but it also says that HD capacity is subject to change, and one should checkout their website at [...] for most updated HD capacity.I will definitely buy this again."}], "B002LITT42": [{"review_id": "0c7bf49e435e0c3b833a807a540f3eb5", "review": "I have to assume that the folks who have had problems with this camera either have not completely read the manual that comes with it or are too quick on the trigger for shooting (all digital cameras need a second to focus properly before fully depressing the button), or they received a lemon (which is why companies provide warranties) and they should have either return the camera to Amazon, as defective, for a replacement or to Canon for fixing.  I have found Canon Service to be Excellent over the years.  I have used them on a couple of occasions.  On one, the camera was well over a year out of warranty, the cost to me was going to be about $149 to fix.  After they received it, they wrote to me that this was a component that has been failing, and should not, and thus there would be no charge for the service.  Now, I can not ask for a more honest, customer oriented manufacturer than these folks.Now, it is true that because there is a \"popup\" flash, I needed to learn to hold the camera differently.  The way Canon suggested is Great as it gives me, and the camera, far more stability than the old way. I did use my left hand finger on top of the camera in a pincer hold with my other fingers.  Now, it is cradled in my left hand between my thumb and second finger with the first finger cradled along the side of the lens giving me far less shake.  By the way, this flash sure does light things up far better than my other cameras with the built in flash on the front!!!Thus far, the zoom shots have been awesome, everyone is raving about the quality of the pictures I have taken of them,, Low light shots are unbelievably clear as if I was using a flash and the day shots are great.  This Powershot S90 is a super digital camera.Thank you Cannon for a Great Camera."}, {"review_id": "d494521dd02738adf9c82a3cbc69e8cd", "review": "If you read the 5-star reviews of this camera, I can tell you that they are all true. This camera is probably the best P&S; Canon ever made and then some. I have a long history using Canon P&S; and this one is the best ever. I wansn't totally happy with other Canon P&S;, having tried most of them. The control ring around the lens make this camera a step above all of its competitors. Depend on the mode you are in (Av, Tv..), the ring functions differently. For example, if you are in aperture priority (Av), turn the ring will change the f-stops. So in Tv, the ring will change your shutter speed. And then you can reprogram it to change something else if you wish. Image quality is superb. No noise or any bluring even at actual-pixel level. Astoundingly sharp with sufficient light and way above average low light performance. And just imaging you can put all this in your pocket!Now, Amazon customer service. I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago *on Amazon* for $429. Today it is $406 *on Amazon*. If I want my $23 credit, I have to return the camera and order a new one. Amazon's new policy does not allow credit in this situation. Just imaging buying a large item and price drops the next day for several hundred dollars. All other retailers would be happy to give you credit for it, but not Amazon. First time I was ever disappointed at Amazon."}, {"review_id": "15a1e9771cd7c6e71cbd923728cd825e", "review": "Of course, there is no such thing as the perfect camera.  But man, does this come close!  I have never been so happy with a camera -- and I've owned quite a few.Right off the bat, the sensor size is larger than on your average P&S; (point and shoot) camera, but the resolution isn't any higher.  This allows the camera to take MUCH better pictures in low light.  And you will be amazed at how good this camera is in low light!  Short of a DSLR camera, it has no equal.In addition, this camera is built for the serious enthusiast.  Full manual controls make it almost like having a DSLR in your pocket!  And there is a control dial plus a control ring -- making it much easier to control your settings.  Plus, a fast lens and the ability to shoot in RAW ... no wonder so many photographers consider this the best pocket camera available.  And yet, you can keep it in Auto mode and treat it like any other point & shoot.Oh, and the LCD is truly beautiful!The main thing that keeps it from being \"perfect\" in my estimation is the limited zoom: less than 4X.  I need much more zoom.  But I'd give it all up for this camera!  And, if you want to use the camera as a camcorder, the standard definition video mode is a bit disappointing.  Why not high-def, Canon?The main problems with the camera are pretty minor.  The control dial on the back is very loose and you have to be careful not to accidentally change your settings.  It's also a shame that you can't independently set the control dial and control ring for whatever you want: instead, you have to choose among a number of pre-sets.  It's a little disappointing.  And, if you are very serious, it's worth noting the serious barrel distortion in RAW; but the camera takes care of that in processing JPEGs, so most will never know.Some people complain about the build quality.  Trust me, it's perfectly fine.  It's light, which can be misleading.  But there's nothing wrong with the build quality.  Perhaps they expect more for $400.  I guess I can understand that.  But I'm perfectly comfortable with the build quality.The competition for this camera are the Panasonic LX3, the Fujifilm F200EXR, and maybe the Sony WX1 or TX1.  The Sonys are good low-light cameras, but have no manual controls.  The LX3 and the F200EXR are more serious cameras, but they are no better than the S90 and much more difficult to use.  The S90 seems to get things right right out of the box more often than these others ... from all that I have heard, anyway.  I don't have any of these cameras.  But don't discount ease of use when you consider the competition.I give this camera the highest recommendation possible, even if it's not quite perfect!"}], "B002MAPRYU": [{"review_id": "2ab712f44ab22921f00ac4a26751c512", "review": "I've owned an iriver, a sony, and and ipod.

If you are looking for a strictly for an MP3 player that is easy to use and sounds great this is a good buy. First off it's tiny.  You can clip it on your lapel, jacket or put it in your pocket. It is very easy to use. No messing with software or bloated programs. I plugged it in to the USB port and that was it.  I guess it could have a longer battery life but that doesn't bother me much as it charges quickly.  The sound quality is really good for such a tiny device.  I spent time and money trying to make my ipod sound better (upgraded earphones etc.) The clip sounded good right out of the box. It synced quickly even from my old computer. Overall, I can see why people love this MP3 player.My only complaint was that the first one I received was defective. I don't know if it got damaged during transit. It was sluggish and had low battery life.

Also has a delete file function unlike the stupid ipods.Another great feature is that under linux I can simply drag to copy the files to the memory card on the player without having to use software.

I've had it for a few months and wanted to make sure it wouldn't cheat me before reviewing. Its battery life is quite good--definitely 5+ hours of MP3. The battery indicator is perhaps not fantastic; I've found it run out of juice at times I wouldn't necessarily have expected it. I guess it works, but it's not linear, so don't assume you have half power left when the battery bar is half full (but then most devices are terribly calibrated for battery power, aren't they?).Sound is fine. Frankly, who knows. I use cheap earphones and crank music while working out with this.Radio reception is quite good.The thing is small and light.

I really like to navigate mp3s like I do within windows--I don't care about ID3 tags, genres, etc.--and it seems a bit iffy for that.I have to give HUGE PROPS to this thing's FWD and RWD and this is absolutely beyond equal in its awesomeness. Since I listen to a lot of very long tracks I make great use of this. Basically if you hold down to go forward or backward, the longer you hold it the faster it gets. So for example hold it down for five seconds and perhaps it's skipped ahead 1 minute of track. Hold it down 5 seconds more and perhaps 3 minutes of track. Keep holding it down and it starts going ahead minutes at a time, it's a very nice feature and I cannot stress enough how nice this little touch is. It's kind of like the wheel: once it was invented you wonder how life could have been worthwhile beforehand. At least that's what my grandfather told me when it was invented and he was a boy."}, {"review_id": "96fb271d99e1e77db3894fa3c2e959bb", "review": "My wife I have have used the Philips Go Gear MP3 players from amazon for a long time.

After my player broke, I ordered the \"newer\" version of this player, and it sucked. I had to exchange it, and the new one wouldn't work either! Also, the newer version likes to download album art without permission. Personally I don't care for the album art; it just takes up space. This has a mini slot for charger instead of a micro, but a small inconvenience for the quality you get in this.

Price is cheap but if they only last 3 months the value is low.I'll try to warranty it but they'll probably blame on misuse.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++With a little threatening, they replaced it. So we'll give them credit for standing behind the warranty.  I have it sitting around because I just don't like the short battery life. My 4 year old Nano 2 goes for 12-15 hours compared to the 6-7 hours of this unit and I got tired of it always running out of batteries on me.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I'm very satisfied with this unit with one exception. I only get approximately 7 hours of listening time. This is leaving the unit on at a fairly high volume and doing nothing more than listening to books. I subtracted 2 stars because battery life is important to me and I've already run out a few times.I'm using it for Audible exclusively. I had a Ipod Nano 2nd generation and prefer the Sandisk Clip+ unit. This review is for Audible Users, others probably won't be interested in it. I was looking through the reviews and couldn't find a review that would describe the interaction of this unit with Audible Useage.1. Very small and compact- The unit is really tiny. All I want to do is listen to books. The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger.2. Great Sound-This unit sounds as good or better than my Ipod.3. Simple Navigation buttons-Took less than 5 minutes to learn.4. On off button which I use as Pause too. It is well located to the top directly over where the headset plugs in, I can find it by feel and don't need to see it. So it is convenient to find an use. When you turn off the book while running it comes back on at the same point still running. The time to turn on and start playing the book is less than 5 seconds. I've found that this feature is key to my enjoyment of using the unit with Audible. No fumbling through the other buttons to find pause.5. Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. No cumbersome hard to find slide mechanisms. Where this unit blows away the Ipod units is that there is no touch sensitive wheel. Everything is push button. Without that sensitive wheel, I've never had to lock the unit. I had an Ipod which used the wheel which is sensitive so I always had to lock it. Big pain in the neck.7.Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. I prefer this to the ipod system.8. It organizes each book into it's own separate folder so it's an extra click but your books are organized together9. When part 1 of a book ends it automatically go to the next part.But won't open a new book. This is advantageous because if you fall asleep with Audible running than it runs to the end of the part of the book you are on, than the next part (if you aren't on the last part) and than it goes to sleep. This can reduce battery drain.IE listen before going to bed.10. Uses the standard Mini USB connector (the one that's bigger) so you can charge and Sync with the standard one used on many devices. I just bought 2Technocel MV9MCDUO-SP OEM Sprint Dual USB Port Car Charger - Blackalong with 2Dual Micro USB / Mini USB Splitter Cable - Charge up two Devices (One Micro and One Mini USB) Once From a Single USB Port - Ideal for mp3 players, Digital Cameras, Smartphones (Android, BlackBerry, HTC, Samsung), GPS, and More. This gives me 2 micro USB and 1 Mini USB in my Autos. With 1 of the Micro USB being rapid charge. I love devices with standard Micro USB connection. By the way I have aDMMR: Dual mini USB and Micro USB to USB Sync and Charge Cable (Retractable)at my office and it charged and transferred data flawlessly with this unit.I have a mini usb connection at home that I use for my Card Reader also transferred data and charged it.  Hurray. It's standard Micro USB.12. Fast Forward and Rewind are as good if not better than the Ipod and convenient. Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. This is advantageous because it allows for both slight f forward/Reverse and extreme f forward/reverse14.Expandable Memory using Micro SDHC. It was just so inexpensive I bought a 8gb MicroSDHC on Amazon for $6.00+ delivered8GB Sandisk MicroSDHC Memory Cardthis one is class 4 don't buy the class 2 might be too slow. With how cheap memory is it's better to buy the 4gb unit and upgrade instead of the 8gb unit. 4 gb does hold alot of books.15. Convenient Eject system from computer- I kept looking for the eject on my Windows Machine to disconnect. Finally I went to the manual. Turns out that as long as you aren't synchronizing you just pull the Unit out with no damage. Very convenient.15. You can listen to it while it's charging.The glitches:1. Battery life. Audible Playback only at fairly high volume using headphones. I only got around 7 hours. my Ipod Nano gets 14 hours. I had to take 2 stars off because that would be a deal breaker for many.2. For Audible can only use the Audible Manager.Remember Audible books are DRM Protected so you need the Audible Manager to decrypt and put on the Clip+3. Their is no way to organize the order of the books. It goes in Alphabetical Order (If I'm wrong please tell me how to do it in comments.4. Itunes tried to take over so I had to remove ITunes but I think that there is a setting or way that I could disableItunes from turning on automatically. Also my original default was through Itunes. Just be aware there may be issues withItunes and Audible Manager on your machine. Probably you can get around it.5. The books are grouped by Books. So if you are in part 1 of a book it'll play part 2 but won't go to the next book.Since it doesnt' go automatically. You have to stop and fiddle with it. This could be inconvenient for example if you are driving. Unfortunately once the book is organized on the machine their is no way to change the order. I have some books where it decided to put the Part 2 at the top and part 1 below. I tried accessing the drive in MTP mode which turns it into a hard drive. In Mtp Mode it showed as in order. So there was no way to fix a problem that doesn't exist when accessing the unit as a hard drive. To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button&lt;Settings&lt;System Settings&lt;USB Mode&lt; For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode.6. I'd prefer that it used a Micro USB connector which is used on most newer phones.7. Controls are very small. I have to hold it in front of me to use all the buttons except the on off and volume button.8. When Fast rewinding or forward my Ipod used to allow me to hear the words so it was easier to find the spot. This is totally silent.9. If I turn unit off and than back on sometimes it will resume at the beginning of the chapter that I was on. But I had the same problem with my IPOD. So I don't believe it's a Clip+ specific problem.If you like this review please rate it as helpful.

The menu is easy and the use of sd micro cards give you lots of storage space. The only drawback is the battery life. I work alone and listen to audiobooks for long periods of time. The clip+ will only play the high quality audio files provided by a well known online book store.  The description says the clip+ will get UP TO 15 hours of  play time. This is using very low quality mp3 files. With audiobooks the battery last about 3 hours.

It feels solid and well-made. However, they don't tell you it's optimized for use with the Rhapsody music service, which I thought was a little sneaky. The music service is free for 30 days, then it costs $10 a month thereafter, but you can cancel anytime. I haven't looked at the music they offer and probably never will. I didn't want a music service. I wanted an MP3 player. Apparently, there are features for this MP3 player that are only available through the Rhapsody download. I haven't set it up yet so I don't know what that means. The owner's manual is a PDF file on the San Disk site, if you can find it. If you register your player with them, they may share your information with overseas sites that aren't secure. Spiffy. At least they're upfront about it, in a vivid red ink disclaimer, but still...why??? The player has a built-in FM radio and microphone. The display is very easy to read. It is packaged with ear buds and a USB charger.June 10, 2013: UPDATE!Okay, now that I've finished having a panic attack, I can happily report I was wrong about the Sansa Clip+ MP3 player. The Rhapsody Music Service software CD is optional. I used Amazon's Cloud Player download instead. So far, all the device's features are working fine. The ear buds packaged with the Sansa Clip+ are  comfortable. The sound quality is excellent. The display is easy to read, even in bright light. The battery charged in less than three hours. I kept thinking the display looked weird, then I realized I was looking at a stick-on screen protector. It peeled off easily and left no residue behind. The menus are simple and well thought out. All the controls are easy to find, easy to use. The USB 2.0 transfer cable is very short, about 9 inches long, but it wasn't a problem. The Sansa Clip+ plugged in to my laptop and the music transfer was a breeze!

But is the MP3 player decent or not?  The price really shouldn't matter or decide whether it's good or bad.  And the truth it, it's both.For one, the Rhapsody software it want you to use is junk.  Get rid of it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to and it's clunky, crappy, outdated software.  The way to sync media with this device is with Windows Media Player.  It works best and is the program that makes the most sense.Now to the device.  For one, the buttons are spotty on mine.  Occasionally, the pause button just decides to not work, so I essentially have to shut the thing off at that point.  Which isn't a big deal if you're just listening to songs.  But if you listen to audiobooks or radio shows you've recorded or podcasts, it doesn't ALWAYS save your location on the file.  It usually does, but again, it's spotty and occasionally the device just decides to not save where it was in the file.Another major problem I've had is the battery life.  I'll turn on my device to see it with 50% power.  Then, about 20 minutes later, it shuts off inexplicably and tries to tell me that the battery is empty.  Great.Now this thing is light and I like that.  It clips very comfortably on to your clothes and the clip is sturdy.  So that's one in the plus column.  It's inexpensive but at no point using this device have I forgotten that.  It feels cheap through and through.  And really... it's not all THAT cheap.Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do.  It plays music files.  You can create custom playlists in WMP or whichever syncing software you choose and it's cool.  Navigating through menus is pretty straight forward.  The sound is decent.Everything about this MP3 player is average at best.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you're looking for a solid MP3 player that's light and relatively inexpensive, I personally think you'll be fien here.  It's great for working out and things like that.  I paid nearly $60 for mine and for that price, it does it's job.  Nothing more though.  It doesn't impress me or leave me blown away.  It just does what I paid it to do."}, {"review_id": "bde478f66166c8abae808ee85013309b", "review": "Fantastic. I dubbed mine \"The iPod killer\". After fighting my old 3rd gen 8gb iPod nano for a few years. I decided enough was enough and I wanted something that I could use in whatever mannerism I wished to. So, i bought the 8gb clip+, a 16GB micro SD card and installed rockbox(a free third party firmware) onto the clip. I could not be happier with the results, people are constantly amazed when i tell them that i managed to build a 24GB mp3 player with custom firmware and in this size for only $75. It really can't be beat except for on battery life. However, I don't really see how you could ever kill the battery in one day and it would probably even be quite unlikely in two days. I charge mine and switch around music every few days without it ever dying on me.Pros-Portability-Clip-micro SD slot-High Capacity to begin with-ability to change firmwares and to use product as you wish (ex. click and drag files instead of using clunky programs)Cons- I can only think of one and that is the battery life. I could see the battery getting weak enough to where it might die within a long days use and that would be troublesome for me. But, as of right now I charge every few days and have no worries. I WILL update if i ever see any decline in battery life to the point of it bothering me.-I also would like to note that the text might prove kind of hard to see out of the box for people with any problems seeing smaller text. However, with the use of 3rd party firmware you can change the text to any size that you want. But, keep in mind it requires some effort to install the 3rd party firmware and even then the screen is still small, so larger text gets kind of cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with problems seeing, but on the other hand I can't really think of many media players that I would. Definitely nothing that is even close to the size of this device.Summary: All in all I couldn't have bought any device close to the capacity as this one for as much as I paid for the device and the SD card. Throw in the fact that it is so small and that I can put on whatever firmware I want and just drag and drop my files and I'm simply astounded by this product."}, {"review_id": "fa200e424cc7baac355f2adaebac9bc0", "review": "I've known people to have problems with the 4GB model, but my 2GB works just fine even after 2 years of regular use. I don't load any songs onto the player itself. Instead I use a 16GB MicroSD card which transfers music much faster and stores much more. I don't have anywhere near 16GB of music, but it's nice to have the option for expandable storage rather than be stuck with however many gigs Apple allows you. Transferring music works just like transferring files to and from a flash drive (because it basically is, especially if you use a MicroSD card). Pull up your music library folder and your storage folder and transfer as necessary. Easy as pie. There will be no doubt as to which songs are on your device.This player is quite small but never uncomfortable to use. The screen is bright enough to be clearly visible in sunlight and the colors contrast so that the text stands out. The buttons are solid and have been quite durable. I greatly prefer having a solid directional pad than a touch circle or touch screen. Separate power and volume buttons seal the deal for great controls. The interface is clean and simple, giving you easy access to sorting music by artist, album, or song, as well as a radio and audio books for those who are interested.I only have two problems with the player that I easily get around. It does not read MP4s, so I use a free M4a to MP3 Converter that I got from CNET.com. And because the player sorts by artist or album, not both at the same time, you'll end up with albums spread across multiple artists. For example, I have an Eric Clapton collection that spans his whole career. The album includes songs from Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, and songs featuring BB King or J.J. Cale. Each one is labeled as a new artist separate from Eric Clapton, so to listen to their songs I have to go to the artist rather than have the whole album filed under Clapton. Minor complaint but Zune did it and I liked that.Easily the best player I have owned.

With much that is new, even those familiar with Canon SLR's, should be prepared to spend some time frequently consulting the often confusing manual.Looking to upgrade from the 40D, I passed on the 5D Mark II, because its 3.9 frames per second shooting rate is inadequate for shooting sports.  With the new features and a shooting rate of 8 FPS, the 7D was my choice.

The 7D has a new arrangement of controls for users to get familiar with.  The mode dial is similar to the 5D Mark II (no 'Sports', 'Portrait, 'Landscape', etc).  The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial.  The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras.  Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D.  Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D.  The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted.  The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials.  Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest.  For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond.  The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area.  The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased.  Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult.  Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame.  One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot.  This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects.  If only there was a focus point nearby.  Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D.  The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using  the Zone AF function.  This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots.  Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus.  The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter.  The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes.  The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal.  The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face.  As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display.  I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod.  For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second.  Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty.  Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D.  Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous.  You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content.  For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing.  The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad.  I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken.  Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products.  Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available.  Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous.  You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important.  The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it.  The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images.  It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands.  It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.  Have fun taking some great images."}, {"review_id": "db1b152e4c8cc2b24436041fa618a678", "review": "This is actually my first DSLR camera. I am not new to photography and the peripherals that go with the business, I use to be in the video field, filming weddings,parties and everything else a customer needed. I decided to get into photography and extend my love for this media. I have been looking at numerous cameras including Canon, Nikon and a few others, I even thought about getting a full-frame camera but my budget thought otherwise. I scoured the reviews on said cameras and finally put my money down on the Canon Eos 7D. Boy am I glad I did! This fine instrument of art really shines. When you first pick it up you can feel the quality,the camera is laid out to make it easy for you to do your job. I purchased the kit with the 28-135 IS USM lens. I am still learning this fine camera but so far it has been a breeze to get to know, The menu is very imformative and if you know absolutely nothing about cameras you can start out by putting this in \"Full Automatic Mode\" The camera will make all the settings for you (iso,aperture n so on)but the fun begins when you open this beast up and put it into manual mode, go ahead and try it, the only way you will learn your camera is by trying different options in manual mode. After playing with it you will know this camera and come to love what it can do. Want to fire several photo's in rapid sucession? the 7d does it very fast and with no problem . . . .however, in order to do this you need a fast memory card. I purchased a card with 60mb speed and this gives me plenty of power to let the 7d open-up and come to life! I will give a more detailed review in about 6months. But if you are like I was and trying to figure out which camera to get I can only tell you that this camera is better than I thought it would be, easy to use and a heck of a lot of fun. It takes beautiful pictures with outstanding detail and clarity, and since it is a Canon product you know it is a quality camera. Just ask the pro's!"}, {"review_id": "6c91167c5abf8ebe1a94636992068e9e", "review": "I have been shooting motorcycle track photography for about 3 years now.  The fist year I shot with a Canon Rebel T2i (AKA 550D)  The image quality was good on this camera but the speed was lacking.What I didn't realize until I got the 7D was how much the speed was lacking.  The T2i is a great camera in it's own right and for consumers it's very good.  When I bought it I thought, hey it has virtually the same sensor as the 7D this should be good enough.Well, I had no idea how much difference the 19 cross type AF points would make, or how much faster 8 FPS was.  My keeper rate went up immediately.  Now, I realize there are other features I could mention, like the  7D is able to control off camera flashes without the use of a 500 series flash,  but really the reason to buy this camera is speed.  This is Canon's best crop frame sensor camera body, hands down, nothing else comes close.  For my purposes the cropped sensor is an advantage as it multiplies my effective focal length by 1.6 and ISO performance is not terribly important as I'm shooting in daylight.  But, I've spoken with many other photogs that have the 5D mk2 and mk3 and when they shoot outdoor sports they still use their 7D, it's AF system is just faster, as is it's frame rate and the added low light capability of the 5D is moot at 2pm outside.  Further, I shoot this camera with the double battery Canon vertical grip.  It makes for a big camera.  This fits my hand very well and the whole system feels very rugged and sturdy.  Much more so than the plastic bodied rebel.  If you are to read my other reviews you may be sensing a theme here.  Value.  This body is no exception.It's expensive for the novice and relatively inexpensive relative to other pro bodies but it defintely earns it's xD (single digit D) Canon designation.  It is a true pro body and at $1700 it's still a great deal, just look at how much you have to spend to get a 6D, 5D, or god forbid a 1D, and the 1D series are the first bodies to start to compare in terms of AF performance as the other cameras are more wedding cameras.  For the money, you can't beat the Al Servo performance of this camera.  Of course if money was no object I'd have a 1Dx and all the big boy primes but for me money matters and for my money this camera delivers pro quality.  I'm only excited now to see what the 7D mk2 looks like when Canon decides to best this legendary Camera body."}], "B002QEBMAK": [{"review_id": "569227a8ffa2686f5681c1e48a4d8e1b", "review": "I bought this drive for my WD Live TV Pro player and it works perfectly.

They have it every now and then, even after a year I still see rebates out @ Amazon.Also, one more thing about this mouse is that I live in a pretty high humidity location (Hawaii) and it affects some of my desktop Logitech mice's texture.

Thepackage design was simple and clean. I enjoyed this kind of simple joy whenopening a new product, yet I think it's only possible when a companyprofoundly designs its packaging as well as its product; this makes it feel asif I am unveiling a mystery, and this gadget gave me this feeling!Here are the list of pros:Easy file transferring - just plugged it into USB port, and the new driveappeared on my desktop screen. Then I just dragged the files I wanted to copyout from the folder. I heard that there are some people having issues with themino's built in USB plug, but I did not have any issues. I even tried a coupleof different ports, and it worked flawlessly, although it seemed a bit heavyhanging the whole camcorder in my desktop's USB port (but it workednonetheless!). Things such as 4 port USB hub or USB extension cable wouldsolve the issue if necessary.Doesn't feel cheaply built - I love the brushed metal feel to it. It might bea bit heavier than other plastic camcorders, but it feels very nice when Ihold and shoot. The built quality is excellent and the whole unit feels quitesturdy.Compact - It fits perfectly even in my small hand, and I am still able tocontrol all the buttons in the back with my thumb. The size is smaller thanthe iPhone so the grip is very good to hold and shoot (and it shoots HD, whichthe iPhone does not).Touch sensitive buttons - very useful if I shoot outdoors, such as at thebeach or playground sandbox. There is no need to worry about sand graingetting stuck in between buttons and the body. And the touch sensitivity iswonderful.Basic accessories - It comes with a soft case and a wrist strap. The softcase is very useful when you carry it around.Bigger space and longer battery life - This camcorder is designed to shootlonger than the first generation mino HD; therefore, it has about 8GB ofmemory space and a 2 hour lasting battery life. It's more than enough memoryspace and battery life to shoot outdoor activities or events.HDMI out - It's kind of standard these days, so it's a handy feature when Iam anxious to watch the clips on the big screen tv. I simply connect directlyto the TV using a HDMI cable, and it works without any issues.Video quality - Typically, I would not expect a super amazing video qualityout of this tiny camcorder, but mino's 720p HD is more than what I expected.With good weather (enough light), the video quality is amazing, and I can'tcomplain, but under low lighting, I found the video quality disappointing.It's a common limitation of these type of small consumer camcorders, I think;therefore, I am not too surprised about this aspect.There is one thing I wish it came with:The lens cover - It would protect the lens from my kid and blocks dust whenit's not in use. There is, however, a protective glass (or transparent cover)built in, and I think it could be more practical, actually. I can just wipe itwith my finger or something quickly.Overall, this is the simplest and easiest HD camcorder. Settings are easy andthe control buttons are simple and self-explanatory. The only thing to worryabout is what to shoot. The price is worthy, and frankly speaking, I've beenquite content with the camera."}, {"review_id": "f54ac1ea1fa5f208414a6d3266b278b5", "review": "Flip has outdone themselves with this iteration of the Mino! Opening the box gives a really good indicator of how the device is going to look...sleek glossy black face with a nice aluminum case! I pulled the MinoHD out, turned it on, and was shooting HD video 30 seconds later.  There's some setup you can choose to do, like adding the date info, etc - it all takes seconds and then you're done.I initially shot about 10 mins of video and then plugged it in to my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard.  It immediately mounted on the desktop, Flip software launched, and the video was sitting there ready for viewing and sharing.  There wasn't a single second of setup time on the computer... not even my iPhone can get video done this well and this quickly.  In fact, I've been carrying the MinoHD pretty much everywhere now - it's just a better video experience, period.The Flip software is really very good and it worked just as well on a Windows 7 machine as it did on my Mac at home. The camera itself is built extremely well, and Flip added nice touches that most manufacturers don't think matter.  Great example: When recording video the aluminum glows red around the glass and lens to let people know the camera is on. They could have just put a red LED somewhere on it, but they really went the extra distance and designed that kind of stuff IN to the case.The USB connector is really solid, too. It folds back in to the case, and a tiny switch flips it out when needed.  This is also how it charges! No issues getting the battery to full from my laptop's USB port in a short amount of time, and the longevity is fantastic.The video is really, really good.  It easily blows away the iPhone 3GS (but NOT the iPhone 4), and looks nearly as good as the HD video recorded by my Canon T1i DSLR.  When viewed via HDMI on a 55\" Samsung LED, the video is just awesome. Very clear even in lower light conditions! The mic is decent... not the best ever, but it gets the jobs done.  For the cost of this camera, it's build quality, video & audio quality, and ease of use - this is an EASY 5-star review.  Great, great work Flip!

The camera has a nice metal case and attractive appearance.  It is nice and heavy (doesn't feel light and cheap like the Creative).  Included in the box is the camera, a nice felt bag, a nicer-than-necessary quality wrist strap that is detachable, and Quickstart guide.  The power button isn't marked, but I figured out it is the button on the side.  The controls are simple and intuitive.USABILITYIt is obviously designed to be very, very simple.  No fancy features, no detailed customization, not even a picture mode.  Video at 720p PERIOD.  (Flip website: 16:9 widescreen, HD 720p (1280 x 720) at 30 frames per seconds (fps) progressive scan; recorded as MP4 files)  This is what they designed it to do, so it makes sense.  The Creative adds a picture mode, but still has a similar arrangement of buttons, so it is not as easy to get it to do what you want.  With the Flip, the buttons are +/-, left/right, play/trash, record and power.  The +/- and left/right buttons are touch sensitive areas, not buttons, so it is difficult to use them without looking at them.  However, they are backlit, and the buttons that apply for the mode you are in are lit and the ones with no function are dark, which is very nice.VIDEO QUALITYThe video quality is good, although there is a certain expectation that it is not the same quality picture are a larger HD camera could give you, like theSanyo VPC-FH1 HD 1080p Flash Memory Camcorder w/ 16x advance zoom (Black).  After all, the lens can be measured in millimeters.  It certainly exceeds the quality of my iPhone 3GS video, which is much lower in resolution (watch out for iPhone 4!, Flip).  This would certainly be good for Youtube or Facebook sharing of up-close things, but not good at all for anything very far away (tiny lens = no zooming).EASE OF TRANSFERRING/WATCHINGI love how Flip, et al, have made transferring so easy.  Hopefully the days of proprietary connectors and dozens of special cables will soon be behind us.  You just pull the switch to allow the USB connector to pop out the top and hook it up!  It is not bendable, so it is not going to be practical for many users, so you'll need a USB extension cable (can be purchased for cheap online).  Creative does a nice job with a flexible connector, by the way.  I didn't try the video software, but copying the video onto the computer is as simple as copy and paste or just a drag.Hooking it up to your HDTV via mini-HDMI to HDMI cable is a great feature, also, that is great for showing friends or family.Overall, this is a very sturdy, simple device designed for one purpose; and it does it well.  Just don't expect to take it to your next graduation, high school musical or wedding if you're not upfront.Longer-term, I think this category of digital video recorders cannot withstand the onslaught of phones that will be able to do the same thing.[UPDATE 4/12/11] It was announced today that Cisco is killing the Flip business; I guess I predicted correctly."}, {"review_id": "6bf0041d7ab8b50e4557591eb9579563", "review": "The Flip MinoHD is the kind of camera you either love or hate.

Using the Flip MinoHD reminded me of why I was skeptical about buying an iPhone when Apple first launched it and why I ultimately bought one and why I feel the iPhone is a fantastic device despite all of it's limitations. Now on to the Flip...There's not much in the box (camera, soft case, strap), the battery can't be changed, and the memory can't be expanded. There's no CD included (the software is on the device) and no cables are included (or needed for most users). There are almost no settings to play with: set the date, time, beeps on/off, recording light on/off and you're ready to go. The ergonomics are ok. It's tough to make a small device easy to hold and use and the display is small but that's to be expected of such a tiny package.For many products this kind of simplicity would suggest that the manufacturer tried to cut costs (e.g. Apple not including an AC Adapter with iPods). In the case of the Flip the message I heard was clearly different: you don't need any of these things. Since there's not much fiddling to do with settings you're left with actually using it!I tried it outdoors and indoors and took videos of the kids and of scenery. It perform wells in all lighting conditions including low light. Based on on my experience low light is the weak point for the HD Video Mode in my Panasonic P&S; as well as in the mini-DV HD Cameras that I own. The Flip outperforms them all. The audio isn't bad at all and the picture quality is better than anything I've seen in a P&S; and is very comparable to what I get with my Canon mini-DV HD Camera.Overall it's easy to pocket and a pleasure to use for making small video clips."}], "B002RL875A": [{"review_id": "2de57136a7a748882351585e4f2cb981", "review": "I was looking to replace my aging Sony Navitus remote and fell upon the Harmony One.

I toss it on there for one or two hours every few days.  Other interesting points about his type of battery: You should not let it go completely uncharged, ever.  If going to store it for a prolonged period try to get it around 40% to 50% charged before storing.  No need to worry about letting it lose most or all of it's charge before recharging, that applies to ni-cad batteries.

I appreciated the quick response and that I wasn't required to send my old remote back (they just deactivated it in the system so I can't make updates to it), but that doesn't change the fact that I only had a new remote for 30 days before I had to settle for a refurbished one. If this remote continues to work well, and so far it has, I'll have no complaints, but it's something to think about."}, {"review_id": "d36a9d4f704e6505e736f40fe80ee340", "review": "So I have been using my Sony universal remote that costs $60.  It was a decent remote and does have 1-button turn on multiple systems option.  I would say it covers 95% of my need, but when I see this nice touch screen universal remote from Logitech that requires internet/software to sync up, I thought maybe I should pay $160 for the touch screen, and given that it would always have the latest update, it must cover all the edge cases and 100% of my need!  Well boy was I wrong--I didn't even get 1% out of this remote!First I am fairly comfortable w/ computer and I have never had issues installing/updating any software, so it's surprising to me that they can screw this up.  But after running into the below issues, I am going to return it (nope, not going to waste time calling their CS)1.  First issue:  It could find my DirecTV DVDR and I need to get the remote to teach it (hey my Sony UR needs to do this too--without any software!  But fine, I did play along)2.  After configuring the software w/ all the  devices, I try to update the H1 remote.  The update got stuck at 3%.3.  It recommended me that I disable my anti-virus and firewall (already off).  So I did and tried again.  Same problem.4.  Googled \"harmony one stuck at 3%\", turns out it's a common issue (so common that when I typed \"Harmony one st\" it autocompletes \"Stuck at 3%\").  There's supposed to be an alternate way to update using a website (If that's the case, why do I need to install the software on my computer!?)5.  Unfortunately, even using the website, the install still stalled at 3%.  I could probably try to reboot my PC and see if that would make a difference, but nope Logitech I am not going to waste more of my time to fix your product.  Path of least resistance to earn your customer, and you have failed my friend.There was another reviewer (who was lucky enough to actually use the remote) who said he could do all the H1 functions w/ his Sony UR without all the fancy software, by pressing 3-digit codes for each device manufacturer.  I couldn't agree more!  Why not just keep it simple?

The 3-star rating at this point now is ONLY because they are comfortable, lightweight and have great sound quality--when it works.  I own so many pairs of these JBuds as to be ridiculous.  I owned several J2 and every color of the J3 just in the past year.  The last J3 I bought in August I kept as backup in case of failure (I use them for medical transcription, sitting at my desk hardly moving for 10-12 hours daily).  I had a failure of the silver earlier this month only a few months into use; the wires seem to come loose somewhere causing loss of sound in one side. Not even 2 hours of use after opening the brand new black set, they failed. Just like all the others but the lasting time for these silver and black ones has been insanely short, and I'm extremely careful with them. I went back to J2, thinking perhaps there to be a design flaw in the J3.  Nope.  Only 4 hours into use on the first day and one side has already failed.  I'm sick of this.  I've gone through probably a dozen pair of various JLab earbuds now, most within the last year, and the timetable for failure has increased exponentially just in the past few months.  I have given this product more than its fair share of chances.No more JLab products for me. I'm just done.  They used to be amazing and long lasting.

In fact, once while playing NFS: Hot Pursuit (The newest one) the laptop actually went into thermal protection because the CPU crossed 100 degrees (Celsius).On idle, without the fans, it holds steady between 55 and 60 degrees.With fans I'm usually between 38 and 46.So we can easily say this is more than a 20% decrease in heat. And as we know with electronics, the cooler it is, the more efficient it works.I placed one fan directly under the CPU and the other under the RAM.These fans are extremely quiet, so you'll actually forget that they're on!I also disagree with the person that stated that this item cannot be used on one's lap due to the open back design. The fans come covered. And even then, the pad is at an angle so they don't even touch my legs if I'm on the bed. Also, if it's hot, using the laptop on your lap actually helps to keep your legs a bit cooler as well!Be very careful with the fans as you dismount and remount as the clips that hold them in place do seem to be rather cheaply made and will probably break very easily.Also, be gentle with the USB power plug. It also seems to be cheaply made and may break with too rough a use.All in all I have already recommended this product to a friend and would suggest it to anyone whose laptop gets to hot to stay on your leg.I also recommend this highly over the other coolers that have one big central fan. The fact that these fans are removable, you can position them exactly where the problem is.One big central fan with a fancy blue light is pretty... but this one is just purely efficient!Since I've had this item, the hottest I've been able to achieve was 83 degrees.

I've noticed that the smooth texture of the cooler's base and many ventilated holes makes it harder for dust to collect. Several coolers I've owned and seen have had the problem of getting too dusty. Not a problem here.- The two fans give you the option to move them around, placing them wherever you'd like to place it. This is an ingenious feature because now you can move the fans to where you need it most. This is great, considering notebook cooler designs have always been stationary.- Overall good design. The angle and strength of the cooler is excellent and provides hours of comfort. Playing games, editing documents, surfing the internet, all computing tasks are comfortable with this cooler.- I like the idea of having this cooler also be a portable notebook carrier, but doesn't quite work well.

Cooling efficiency is excellent with the two fans - our Lenovo and HP laptops can get a bit warm on the bottom but I found that they stay absolutely cool when on the stand.The fans are powered from a dual USB plug that lets you piggy-back any other device on it so you don't lose a USB port when the fans are plugged in.  The fans can get noisy if they accumulate a lot of dust BUT they easily snap out for cleaning - and you can reconfigure them by snapping them back in virtually anywhere under the stand. This is a really good design because you can reposition one or both to specifically cool off the battery compartment or CPU no matter where it's located in the laptop.

For any other device, the drivers could be on the web... but... if you bought this adapter because your internal wireless adapter is dead, then you can't download the drivers, because you need this device to get on the Internet !  So, it is good that TP-LINK has considered that possibility.  Of course, it's also simpler to just insert the CD.  The only flaw in this system is that some devices have no CD drive - then you will need to use another laptop or PC to either transfer the CD's contents to a USB flashdrive, or else download them from tp-link.us web site and transfer to a USB flashdrive.Anyway, the install was very easy, and all I had to do was click on my router's ID, enter my password, and it was up and running.The wireless G performance is excellent, and the USB extension allowed me to find a point in my bedroom to position the adapter, that always has good wireless coverage from my router, so everything is cool now for using my laptop in bed. :)So far, I've had good experiences with TP-LINK products.

I normally don't review products, but the ability to swipe between programs and scroll from the mouse is great and practically multiplies productivity.As far as ergonomics go, the mouse is just OK.  It seems like it's just a little too thin, but so far I haven't had any pain, just a little discomfort which I'm going to attribute to a learning curve.The final (fixable) issue is the lack of touch commands supported by Apple.  Because the top half of the mouse is essentially a touch pad, it should be that we can do much more than simply clicking, but this isn't really supported.  Downloading a third party plugin (better touch tool for Mac) solved this problem - I can even launch programs by using a custom hand movement just with my mouse.

I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another.

Just about the perfect laptop mouse in my experience.Light, portable and hard-wearing. I've dropped mine many times with no damage or impairment of function.I lost my first one due to stupidity after nearly two years of use and three battery changes(!) and was so bereft I bought another that night even though it was the wrong color. I then used that one to order another red one. It is that useful a device.The buttons have a nice positive click, the wheel is the \"clicking\" sort I prefer with detents in scroll mode and has a tilt function for horizontal scrolling.And if you need to move it from machine to machine, you can store the tiny USB dongle inside the mouse so it doesn't get lost.A winner from Logitech.[EDIT 10/4/13] I started to see false double-click behavior last week and so swapped out my three+ year old M305 with the one I bought for a spare back in November of 2011, which returned sanity to my mouse usage.Three years plus from a mouse that cost me less than $20 and which has been toted around in some very hostile conditions isn't bad. I don't know what has broken, but it gave good service until it did.I would not want to pay the prices I'm seeing for this unit of late. True, the current \"in stores\" model does not have the nice hinged buttons of this one, but a portable mouse is always going to get a beating and should be either armor plated or disposably inexpensive as a consequence. I define this as about $20.All of the above In My Opinion, of course.[/EDIT][EDIT 3/19/14] The USB receiver went out on the replacement mouse after about 11 months usage. The price on these units has risen to the point I can't afford them any more so I bought a 325 to replace it. The 325 is almost identical in use (if not in look) but for the clickless mouse wheel, which I hate. YMMV.

I need another bluetooth speaker for a second car, so I tried T505.Good: The sound of T505 is better than T325 (without using FM broadcasting). It's not louder, but the sound quality is better in mid- to high-frequency. T325 is more on low-frequency sound, which mixes into road and wind noises.Bad: After using T505 for a week I realized how much T325 has been improved on human interface from T305/T505. T325 has auto connect, big call button, and can speak names when a call arrives. T505 has stiff and small buttons, don't do auto connect, and can only speak telephone numbers. As for voice dialing, T505's sound is tiny; it's hard to hear to whom the phone is dialing to. Voice dialing is not very reliable on both T325 and T505, but with T325 I know to whom it's calling and can stop it if the calling name is wrong.FM broadcasting: Only T505 has this feature. The sound is pretty good. However, it searches for a free FM frequency whenever it powers on. That means the frequency always changes. For this reason, it's extremely troublesome to use this feature. I guess if I don't turn T505 off, it's less an issue. However, I don't like the idea of having a tiny FM broadcasting station working over my head all the time. :-)So I decided to return it, and probably will get another T325 or the roadster."}], "B0030MITDK": [{"review_id": "4e5f07be6c5fcfaf777273ec1e8f5355", "review": "Okay we all know this isn't a replacement for a full blown camcorder and certainly not a camera, BUT it is a great product. I personally bought it for it's waterproof capabilities. It takes a DECENT still shot, more than good enough for social networks or emails. More importantly though, the video that it shoots is outstanding. Better than most I've had experience with taken by cameras, plus it's waterproof. I have mentioned that a couple of times now because I feel that is the key aspect with this product.This is a fun camera and small enough to throw in a pocket. Getting to the details on video I have to say that outdoors is where it shines. Indoor shots with normal lighting are also good but low light are viewable but somewhat grainy. Underwater video is equally good. You MUST turn that mode on. Each time the camera is turned off it resets and must be turned on again. It just compensates for the lighting underwater. I've forgotten to turn it on and the video looks good? The digital zoom is remarkably good. Usually digital zoom tends to be less than ideal but this camcorder handles it very well! Much better than expected. I don't hesitate to use it at all, even on full zoom it's good. The manual does not say what the zoom is nor does the camera. People here in the reviews have estimated and I'd GUESS 4-5x.As for the video modes 720p 30fps isn't bad. The picture is sharp and has great color. There can be some shakey almost slightly strobe light effect if you move the camera too fast. The built in image stabilization does help BUT you must turn it on. 720p 60fps is the bomb! I think this is the sweet spot and use this mode most of the time. 1080p 30fps is wonderful though you must again be careful with the camera movement. The image is just plain crisp!! Don't get me wrong this mode is great but it takes a lot of memory and isn't really practical for emailing or uploading to social networks. Looks beautiful on my 58 in. Samsung plasma.Stills as I said are good and a couple outdoor shots I took rival my better camera. Parties, walks on the beach, hanging with friends are good venues for the stills. Important parties, weddings, those moments that really mean something, no, use a dedicated real camera.Battery life is pretty decent. I shoot 30 sec. to 1 min. most of the time then power off and it has lasted through 2 serious parties 40-50 vids at each party with time to spare. Not sure if you just turned it on and let it go for like 5-10 min. vids? My guess is that it wouldn't last as long. That's the WORST way to take vids anyway!! Nothing is worse than a 5 minute or longer video to watch!! OMG, please don't ever force a vid of that length on a friend. Because you can't say anything and have to sit through the whole horrid thing. Show the same vid in 1 min or less clips and it's acceptable. Just my opinion.This has been a great purchase for me. As said the waterproof capability is what sold me. If you don't want to lug the camcorder and camera along this just pops in the pocket. It's inexpensive and FUN, buy it you won't regret itP.S. I think it's as nice or nicer than the Flip.

I am astounded by the poor durability of this unit and am glad I brought my Canon camera w/ UW case as a backup and standby. The Playsport doesn't seem to handle humid conditions well. After getting in the water (no more than 4-5 feet of water in 80-85 degree water temp, 90 degree air temp and 70%~ humidity), I noticed the Playsport was having issues turning on underwater. I immediately got out and started noticing condensation build up on the inside of the screen.  After turning it on again, I started getting a blank white screen and the unit would shut off afterwards. I tried letting it dry out but the unit was just dead. After several days of the malfunction, while on the trip, I noticed some corrosion around the power plug port area and hinges. The seals seem a bit flaky in this respect. I made sure to rinse the unit off with freshwater after every outing.The kicker is that I had used this probably a dozen times in the saltwater without any problems. I'm thinking it's not as rugged as it's cut out to be. After considering how much I used it, I put it through a pretty good stress test overall. Unfortunately, it failed. Kodak support didn't seem very supportive of the issue - they wanted me to return the camera, at my expense, with a 7-10 business day turn around. I didn't really want to deal with the back and forth and an experience like that left a bad taste in my mouth anyway. I'd prefer not to be Kodak's QA dept.That said, the video quality is awesome with what I did capture, but I cannot recommend it to anybody with the problems I've experienced. Maybe it was just my unit, but with this experience I will generally be avoiding Kodak products in the future. This, along with so many other reviews of batteries not working and units not charging, is only proving that Kodak's QA process is shoddy at best.I would avoid this unit until Kodak makes major improvements to the \"waterproofing\" aspect as well as all other issues people have been reporting. Personally, I'm going to wait until more companies release comparable waterproof cams (and better reviews) before making such a purchase. My recommendation is this: be very careful with this unit if you plan on using it for a lot of swimming/snorkeling/underwater stuff - it only takes one time underwater for your camera to be destroyed. And also, be wary of the unit's ability (or lack thereof) in places of high humidity. Otherwise, I'd say it's a bargain camera for anything else. It just doesn't seem as \"rugged\" as it's cut out to be.An additional tidbit or caution to note while handling this underwater. Make *sure* you have a secure hold/grip on this unit or that you secure it well using the wrist strap or whatever you come up with. This thing will sink like a brick if you let go of it in the water! If I had brought it to the place we snorkeled where I brought my Canon (and let go of that...fortunately it floated), I almost surely would have dropped it to the bottom 30ft down. And I would have had a fun little diving excursion in that case.

Firstly, I purchased the product as a refurbished unit and only paid $75 including shipping - I added two additional batteries quite inexpensively through eBay.It is easily portable and seems to have fairly good battery time - here's a sample of 720 P quality - not bad.  [...]I suspect that this is a generic criticism as the small microphones embedded in this type of a video recorder has no resistance to wind.  What you can expect is that if you are moving and experience when passing across the microphone you will get wind noise.My original intention was to use this video camera on my bicycle and to that end, I constructed a helmet cam mount.  This would probably work but I found that the additional weight on top of my helmet was unacceptable - the camera weighs 4.4 ounces - seemingly trivial but noticeable on top of your head.  At five megapixels, the still picture capability is adequate but nothing special.  I chose to get a ZX3 as opposed to the newer ZX5 - there were several reasons for this choice:The ZX3 has removable batteries, the five does not.  The charge coupled device is larger on the ZX three and quite a few sophisticated reviewers felt that the ZX five was a downgrade in some respects.  And then there was the issue of a dramatically lower price.Summarizing, this camera is good enough and portable enough that I will often carry the camera in situations where I would have been lugging my Canon T1 I.

This mouse is terrible.  I've got a cheap bundled no-name mouse on my laptop, and I'm stealing it and throwing this one away.

At first it was now and then, making me think I'd clicked twice.  Six months later, it's a constant thing, probably about 80% of the time.The tracking is also not great.  With a mouse pad it's bearable, without one it's impossible.  Either way, sometimes small movements just don't happen at all.

Anyway, this one is still going strong, and I don't think I've ever had to change the batteries since purchasing.It has a button on top below the scroll wheel that will let you make the scroll wheel either tactile so that it \"clicks,\" or free so that you can scroll super fast. Awesome feature. You can also program the thumb button- a nice feature. The mouse is a touch on the large side for me, but it feels nice in the hand. Sometimes the top button that controls the scroll wheel can get in the way, but it's really not a big deal to me- in fact, I usually just use it as a rest for my scrolling finger.As stated in other reviews, if you think the mouse is too heavy, you can actually remove a battery and it will still work.Overall, it's a great mouse that has held up longer than any of the others I've owned. Worth the money!EDIT (3-3-13): I've owned this mouse for about two years now, no issues. The scroll wheel still glides (or clicks, whichever you prefer) without issue, and no problems with any of the buttons. As mentioned in the original review, any other mouse I've owned was toast by this point. As far as I can recall, I still have not had to change the batteries in this thing, and I pretty much never turn the power on it off - like, ever. Every once in a while when traveling (which is almost never), I'll have the forethought to turn the power off before putting it in my bag, but 90% of the time it stays in the \"on\" position while sitting on my desk.

Even though advertised as a 'laptop mouse', I found it fit my hand better than the desktop version.  But they never lasted - the left click would last a year or two, and I'd have to replace the mouse.  This time the VX Revolution was discounted so I had to search for a replacement.  The M705 turnout to be like the VX Revolution refreshed....I've been using the M705 for about two months now and I'm a happy camper.  The mouse has a great shape and fits in my right hand very well .  top buttons are comfortable and snappy.  And the thumb buttons are in a great location - not in my way so I keep clicking them, but no so far away I have to stretch the thumb.  The left and right surfaces have a gripping surface, but your fingers won't stick to them.The M705 has two more features I've gotten used two.  There's a third 'hidden' thumb button.  When you press the thumb down it can trigger another function (I have it set to Expos&eacute;).  The scroll wheel also has a handy button next to it.  Usual wheel response is your standard 'notched' feeling (click-click-click as you scroll).  There's a small button out-of-the-way behind the scroll wheel that will switch between 'click' mode and smooth mode.  In smooth mode the wheel will spin freely.  And it's very free - it'll spin for a good 15-20 seconds on the new mouse.  if I have a huge browser window to scroll through, smooth-mode is great!  I don't know how I would live without it.The mouse comes with the 'standard' Logitec control center software, which is working just fine on MacOS 10.6.  Actually, I didn't have to install any software - I had it installed for the VX Revolution - so the Control Center automatically recognized the new mouse with no problems.Not many downsides.  This mouse takes two AA batteries rather than just one - not sure why that is.  There is an on/off switch on the bottom if you want to save batter life.  And, like every mouse I've ever owned, the feet pick up a lot of dust and such from the desk.  No worse than any other mouse.

The buttons were unobtrusive and I never hit them unintentionally.I tested several other unifying receiver mice made by logitech and this was the one that fit my ergonomic needs the best.  TheLogitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Macdoes have a good selection of features but it was too small.  TheLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macwas too big and not at all for left handed use.  TheLogitech LX7 Cordless Optical Mouse - Dark Blue ( 931395-0403 )is my backup mouse and is OK and theLogitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black)was the next choice if just going off of ergonomics and comfort, but for the price and lack of features I decided to look outside of Logitech.What I found instead was theMicrosoft Explorer Mini Mouse.

Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Word was designed to be used with a mouse, and putting it simply, it was a clunky device with a weighted ball mouse inside, and had a cord that plugged into the serial port of the PC. But for this user, it was an amazing device that made word processing far easier.In 1984, PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak stated the mouse as a reason the Macintosh would fail. That obviously didn't happen, and the rest is history.I bought thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessas a result of having two from another manufacturer that were having problems with the rubberized sides peeling off, and because the small 'glide pads' on the bottom had peeled off after using them for a few years. Had bought aLogitech Wireless Mouse M505for my MacBook Pro earlier this year as a replacement, and this new one from Microsoft was destined for use with my Windows 7 PC. Sometimes it's good to have products for comparison.Likes:+ Blue Track Technology; offers excellent tracking, very smooth+ Rubberized sides; provide a very comfortable grip+ On/Off switch; located on the base, saves battery life+ Excellent ergonomics; fits the hand quite nicely+ Behaves well with both Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.8.x+ Nano Transceiver; stores easily in base when being transported+ Scroll wheel has good sensitivity; smooth and stable+ Runs from one AA battery; included; Microsoft claims up to 8 months life+ Ambidextrous; works well with right or left hand operation+ Good packaging; comes in a cardboard box that's easy to openDislikes:- None so farOverview:I was curious how thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessmight be different from theMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 - Loch Ness Gray. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it all seems to be in the packaging. The one marked \"3500 for Business\" comes in an easy-to-open recyclable brown cardboard box, which is a plus point for this user... no clamshell packaging to deal with.This mouse is smooth and easy to set up... it's simple plug & play with either the PC or the Mac, and I've tested it with both. It's responsive, and though the scroll wheel has a slight \"bumpier\" feel than the Logitech M505, it's adjustments are easy to adjust within the Windows Control Panel. The Logitech has a greater life with batteries, but that's because it uses two AA batteries as opposed to one AA cell with the Microsoft product, so that's a wash.As far as sensitivity and accuracy go, both of these models appear to be about equal, and both can be customized to fit your needs from within the software settings. The Logitech M505 is slightly longer, and the Microsoft is almost identical in size and shape to a Logitech M305; both fit the hand quite well and have an excellent ergonomic feel. Only time will tell if the rubberized sides and feet will stay on longer than those on the Logitech M305. Looking back across the history of the various Microsoft (and other) mouse units that I've had over the years back to the days of those with wired interfaces, it's amazing how much the technology has progressed over the years.TheMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessfeels and works like a good, solid product, yet it would be hard for this user to recommend it above the Logitech M505. Though slightly different in size and shape, both have an excellent ergonomic feel. The Microsoft 3500 with its Loch Ness Gray finish does have a good, businesslike appearance as opposed to looking like a work of art, so if that matters to you, then it's a good choice.11/23/2012"}], "B0035FZJHQ": [{"review_id": "bb047fce5b1f5704f7c6c97c716fae7d", "review": "I bought this kit camera a year ago and I had lot of fun learning with it.  The image quality is excellent even on higher ISO for low light condition, even with slow kit lens.  The good things about this camera are image quality, light weight and low price.  The not so good things are the ergonomics and build quality.  I have now upgraded to the 60D mainly because of wireless speedlite control and the articulating lens.  The image quality from T2i is indistinguishable from the 60D using the same lenses."}, {"review_id": "e884f66159043823040843d60ff5cf8a", "review": "Whether you're new to the world of DSLRs, or are a seasoned photographer who wants to try your luck at video, the Canon Rebel T2i is perfect. I've had nothing but great experiences with it so far, and highly recommend to everyone.Other than the T2i, I own (and primarily shoot with) the Rebel XS (1000D), and also have extensive experience with the Canon 50D. While my XS still serves me very well, I wanted to get an SLR with video capabilities since the release of the T1i. After finally saving up enough for the T1i, I really lucked out that Canon announced the T2i, which has even better features! I am lucky enough to finally have it, and want to share my experiences, and how they compare to my expectations==================OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThe camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't \"feel cheap\" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.==================PROSIMAGE QUALITY: I feared that cramming so many megapixels onto this sensor, there would be a lot of image 'noise' (the megapixel myth). This thankfully hasn't been an issue, and I've been very pleased with the pictures taken with this camera! Aside from White Balance issues (see below, Cons), image quality is pretty good!VIDEO: Some people have disparagingly said that Video on DSLRs is just a gimmick. I disagree. Based on sample clips I'd seen on YouTube, I was excited about getting an HDSLR, and while videos are sometimes shaky if you don't have very steady hands, a tripod eliminates those concerns. Audio quality on the T1i was criticized by many, but the T2i has a microphone input jack, which allows you to connect a mic. I don't yet own one so can't comment on that feature, but will update this review if and when I save enough to try this feature out. Additionally, this offers improved recording options, including higher fps (frames per second) than the T1i, which technically offered \"true HD\" recording of 1080, but only at a choppy 20 fps.LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE: I am much more impressed than I expected. My Rebel XS could go up to ISO 1600, but would perform pretty poorly there. This not only can go up to a significantly higher ISO level, but performs much better. Less image noise means you have to waste less time editing your pics, and many more keepers!SDXC SUPPORT: Only own SDHC cards up until now, but it's great to know that this supports the next generation of flash storage, which means you'll in the future be able to hold many more pictures than currently available.CONSNOT A FULL-FRAME SLR: This is not a full-frame SLR like the Canon 5D Mark II, and the APS-C sized sensor results in a crop factor (1.6x), and doesn't necessarily provide the same image quality as the larger, full-frame sensor does. Still, at less than half the cost of the Mark II, I think this is a trade-off that's well worth it for most users.Crop factor means that this camera, like other Canon DSLRs that have the APS-C size image sensor, will not be true to the lens's designation. A 50mm lens will produce an image more in line with 50mm x 1.6, or 80mm on a full-frame. This not only makes a difference for those who want to do landscape photography (which usually benefits from wide-angle views), but for those with unsteady hands. The general logic is that to ensure a steady shot, you need to shoot at the reciprocal of your focal length. So for a 50mm focal length, you should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/50 second for a steady shot. Keeping the crop factor in mind, you really should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/80 a second.Crop factors are common for most digital SLRs, as full-frame sensors jack up the cost of production, which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of very expensive cameras. So it's not so much a shortcoming of the Rebel T2i, but just a note to keep in the back of your mind.DIFFERENT BATTERY: This is more of a hassle for those who owned spare batteries than for those whose first SLR would be the T2i, but Canon changed the battery. Again, not such a big deal, but might be a hassle for some who find out that their old batteries can't be used on this model.WHITE BALANCE: I found that the 'Auto' White-Balance setting was wildly inaccurate on my Rebel XS (often giving indoor shots a yellow tint unless I changed the WB to the 'Incandescent Light' mode), and I feel that the WB settings on this model still aren't as accurate as they should be. If you want truly accurate WB, you can use a gray card, or an alternative would be to simply try digitally editing the photos on your computer after shooting.NO ARTICULATING SCREEN: No articulating screen, but this is a rare feature in DSLR's in general, so it's not a shortcoming of the T2i. Since most of your shots will probably be composed using the viewfinder, not a big deal, although it would have been convenient! If you absolutely must have an articulating screen on an HDSLR, look into the Nikon D5000.===================A NOTE ABOUT THE KIT LENSThe lens that comes with this is the standard 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 that comes with the other Rebels. It's a very good all-around lens, but you more likely than not will want to at some point upgrade your lens for either (a) better image quality, or (b) better performance in low-light conditions.This lens is very good, but for pros or those who pay incredibly close attention to detail, the optical quality of Canon's higher-end lenses is superior than to the kit lens. For most users, I don't think image quality will be a huge issue.More likely, the aperture size will be the reason people want to upgrade their lens over time.  A lens with a wider aperture allows more light to reach the sensor in less time than a lens with a narrower aperture. That means you can employ a faster shutter speed, which allows you to snap the shot faster, reducing the likelihood of a blurry picture. Outdoors on a sunny day, this aperture range of this lens won't be a limiting factor; inside a poorly-lit gym, however, you'll notice some blurry shots (see below for a recommended alternative for low-light shooting).Still, this is a pretty good all-around lens that can result in some great shots!===================RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES1. An external flash: This will come in very handy. With the built-in flash, your photos often come out harshly lit. Bouncing an external flash off the wall makes a huge difference in image quality. I personally use the Speedlite 580EX II, but there are cheaper alternatives that are very good. Some higher-end cameras (i.e. Canon 5D Mark II) don't even have a built-in flash, which goes to show something about how high-level photographers view the lighting provided by internal flashes.2. 50mm f/1.8 II lens - At around one hundred dollars, this lens is relatively cheap when compared to others on the market. Despite its low price, it offers great image quality. While it lacks IS (image stabilization) like some other Canon lenses (including the kit lens), with a wide aperture of f/1.8, enough light usually comes in to ensure a fast shutter speed, which in turn minimizes camera shake. Keep in mind that as a 'prime' lens, your feet will have to do the zooming in and out. This is not as convenient as an everyday walk-around lens like the 18-55 kit lens which gives a good zoom range, but is a great lens for portraits. Also would ideally be a good option for poorly-lit places where the aperture of the kit-lens isn't wide enough to ensure a steady shot.CONCLUSIONSFrom my list of 4 pros and 4 cons, you might wonder why I'm giving this product 5 stars?... It's because considering the great performance - and low price - of the T2i, the 'cons' I list really aren't that big of a deal. Just because some cameras offer the aforementioned features the T2i lacks, it doesn't mean the T2i isn't a solid performer.  On the contrary, I have been completely satisfied with this camera's image and video quality, performance, features, AND PRICE, and would recommend the T2i to anyone looking for an affordable way to capture memories!------------------EDIT 11/27/10I just wanted to update this review to say that after shooting with the T2i for nearly half a year, I'm still as impressed by this camera as when I first got it. I have a few comments to expand on my initial review:VIDEO  I have been using the video mode a lot more than I initially expected. While it doesn't offer continuous auto-focus and therefore might not replace a camcorder, once you get the hang of manually focusing this is not a big problem. I many times have found myself in situations where photos couldn't capture the moment as well as a video could, and the ability to record clips has been very convenient.A note on the video mode, however...while it's automatic exposure is fine for most situations, if you find your videos are grainy, it's best to manually control the exposure. I've seen that sometimes even in good lighting, the camera will keep the aperture small (to have a less shallow depth of field) and boost the ISO. You can get around that by manually adjusting exposure settings, but again, the automatic exposures are usually fine.As for audio with videos, I personally still have not purchased an external microphone, but for those who are serious about movie production Amazon sells a highly popular 'Rode VideoMic' for a reasonable price. I have looked up videos on YouTube which demonstrate the difference between the built-in mic and an external mic, and while it's  tempting, I'd rather spend my money on better lenses than audio accessories.CROP FACTOR  To clarify on my 'crop factor' point from above on a full-frame vs. a crop-sensor body, there is a useful video on Vimeo that illustrates what I'm talking about. If you Google '5D 7D crop factor Vimeo' it comes up as the first result. As you can see, a full frame camera offers a view truer to the lens designations. Again, full frame cameras are costlier to make and therefore more expensive to the consumer, so APS-C sensor cameras like the Rebel T2i, 60D, and 7D are very good values for the money. But if you are not on a tight budget and think you might one day want to upgrade to a full frame some day for the improved low-light performance, higher image quality, and wider field of view, maybe skip on a T2i and just aim for a 5D Mark II (I personally love my T2i, but am excited about some day having my 24-105 shoot wider than its current effective 38-168 range.). For most users, however, APS-C sensor cameras like the T2i should be great, and some might even find the crop factor useful for telephoto work.LENSES  After spending so much money on a camera body, many people have a difficult time justifying buying expensive lenses, and I understand that. After upgrading from the 18-55mm kit lens to the 24-105L lens, however, I can honestly say that the money is well worth it. Colors are more vivid and truer to real life than the [now noticeably] duller colors produced by the non-L lens, and I rarely use the kit lens now. Again, the 18-55 is very versatile and provides a great value, but if you can afford to upgrade your lens to Canon's L series, you won't regret it. Perhaps try before you buy, to see for yourself what I'm talking about.LOW LIGHT  While this camera offers a boost ISO mode (to 12800 from 6400), I don't use that since its results are too grainy for my liking. But for night shots without a tripod, I have found ISO 3200 and 6400 to be a real advantage over my previous Rebel XS which only went up to ISO 1600, and even then produced noisier images than the T2i at 1600. While this camera doesn't produce high ISO pictures as cleanly as a full frame 5DMk2 does, at a fraction of the price I am incredibly pleased with this camera.MEMORY CARD  Lastly, I wanted to recommend you do a lot of research into which SD card you want to use. Class 6 or higher is recommended, but look into reviews to see how the card actually performs. I used to use a Transcend Class 6 card since it's very affordable, and have had movies abruptly stop recording at inopportune times. I upgraded to a Transcend Class 10, and unfortunately continue to have that happen. Not all Class 10 cards necessarily write at the same speed, so look thoroughly into reviews if you plan on using video mode to ensure you get a reliable, high-speed card. The Transcend cards are a great value for the money, and have many times been fine, but you might want to consider more expensive alternatives for greater reliability.------------------EDIT 01/28/11I wanted to update this review to reflect the fact that the camera is still serving me well, and to recommend some additional accessories I have since paired my T2i with. I recently got theInduro AKB0 Tripod Kit (Black),Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle,Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod, andCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and highly recommend them.CAMERA SUPPORT  With the T2i you can pull off handheld shots in low light by cranking up the ISO, but even though the T2i shows relatively little noise, it does show more than some would like in their shots (especially at ISO 6400). Digital noise can be reduced in post-production, but it's much easier to shoot at a lower ISO in the first place, especially for night shots. After paying so much for a camera body and other accessories, buying an expensive tripod might be the last thing you'd want to do, and I understand that: for a while I was using an older, cheaper tripod that was designed more for light camcorders than SLRs with heavy lenses. While this set-up technically worked, I didn't feel very confident in its reliability. After doing a lot of research and asking many photographers, I got the Induro kit, and have been very happy with it so far. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but it doesn't make sense to skimp on support and risk damaging your gear! With tripods, you have to make trade-offs between price, sturdiness, and weight, and while I'm happy with my tripod, it might not be adequate for your needs. There are many websites with tips on what to look for in a tripod (i.e. ball head, pan-tilt head, etc) that can help you make an informed decision. The Gorillapod is not nearly as essential to your shooting as a dedicated tripod, but I recommend it if you find yourself in situations where you don't want to/might not be permitted to carry a tripod, but need support. It sets up much faster than a tripod which needs to have its legs extended and locked. Lastly, a monopod is a great way to stabilize your shots without the hassle of having to carry a tripod, and is even more portable than a Gorillapod. That being said, it doesn't provide as much stability, so I use it primarily to stabilize video shooting (which can be a bit shaky due to composition through LCD screen instead of viewfinder, especially with a telephoto lens).TELEPHOTO LENS  The T2i has a high resolution sensor that, in my experience, provides for great shots even after cropping. I have taken shots and cropped to 100% and been pleased with results, but sometimes you want extended reach without cropping, and here a good telephoto really shines. Canon and third-party lens manufacturers offer many great telephoto options for the T2i, and it's important to think of what you need a telephoto lens for before investing in one. If you'll primarily be shooting with a tripod, you probably don't need IS; if you're going to be shooting in adequate light, a wide aperture isn't essential. I used the Canon 70-300 non-L non-IS lens, but don't recommend it. Keeping in mind the reciprocity of focal length and shutter speed, Image Stabilization on a telephoto lens makes things much easier for hand-held shooting. I much preferred the 55-250 IS over my 70-300 non-IS (there are also IS versions of the 70-300), but found its low-light performance was weak due to its relatively small maximum aperture size. I recently got the 70-200 2.8 IS II, and am blown away by its fast auto-focus, great low-light performance, and superior optical quality. It is an expensive lens, but is well worth it if you need a fast lens (wide aperture) that features Image Stabilization.--------------------------EDIT 02/07/11 *FINAL UPDATE*NEW REBEL  The T2i's successor, the T3i has just been announced, and will be available in March. Based on its specs, I don't think this is a necessary upgrade for current T2i owners. The main improvements found in the T3i are a swiveling screen, wireless flash transmitter, improved Auto mode detection, an enhanced Movie Zoom mode, and creative filters. Of these, I think the most important or sought-after improvements are the flash transmitter (which is is great for advanced shooters and those who want to explore with lighting) and the swiveling LCD screen (which allows for more flexibility in shooting). While these are useful new features, they are largely incremental and I will be sticking with my T2i. For new buyers, the T3i looks great and is very worth looking into when it comes out. Canon also announced a T3 camera to succeed the Rebel XS, which is great for beginners but is lacking in features compared to the T2i and the newly-announced T3i, including the ability to capture 'true HD' at 1080. Even with Canon's recent announcements, I think the T2i is a great DSLR and I highly recommend it to everyone.----------------------------EDIT 06/13/11 *THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL UPDATE*I know this review is now longer than some novels, but I really can't stress enough how great this camera is. I've used this in a variety of settings, both professionally and for personal use, and it's served me so well throughout. While I've shot events before, last night I shot the Tony Awards in NYC...which meant many thousands of shots over the course of many hours...and I was highly impressed with the T2i's performance. I did have to change batteries during the course of the event, but that was many hours into the event. You can easily get a spare third-party battery for just a few bucks.I recently purchased a cheap (less than 20 dollars) intervalometer from Amazon, and have started creating time-lapse videos with my T2i. Setting up cool time-lapse, and capturing HD video, are two areas where an articulating screen (like that found on the T3i and 60D) would come in handy, but again, this is not an essential feature, so I am pleased with my T2i. The intervalometer I got through Amazon was third-party, but since it cost about a tenth of the official Canon one, I am very pleased and highly recommend it if you want to take your T2i to the next level.The T2i is an amazing camera. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested, whether you never owned an SLR before, or want a second body as a backup. I love the T2i!"}], "B0036AWR8E": [{"review_id": "386efad3b9ea462db40ad7c58b68c60b", "review": "I recently bought the Slingshot 302AW, hoping to be able to carry two bodies (and some extra lenses and accessories) and still enjoy the fast access of a sling bag.But I cannot find the right configuration for this bag. It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment."}], "B0036Q7MV0": [{"review_id": "27052231bc98d7b861aeda35d5cb9f1e", "review": "I can say so far so good!

First off, I received a free pair of the M6P headphones in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will do my best to deliver on my end of the bargain, with a review written for those wondering if they should spend their hard-earned money on the M6P. Secondly, I have never been an in-ear headphone person. I've used plenty of in-ear headphones in my day, but I have always preferred over-ear headsets as I find them to be, nine out of ten times, much more comfortable and high quality in their sound. That been said, I have been massively impressed by these headphones so far. Let's get to it then, shall we?As with any headphones, primary concern for me is sound. How does the M6P fare in that regard? Surprisingly well. I have never owned a pair of in-ear headphones that has had such a good sound range as these do. Usually, this sort of headset is severely lacking in bass and lower-mid tones, but the M6P has a genuinely fantastic range. Of course, the bass isn't quite what you'd get with over-ear phones, but honestly, it sounds pretty great. A little adjustment to equalization settings is all it takes for it to sound the way I like. Highs, mids, and lows are all  distinct and clear, with no one aspect overpowering the others. I've really enjoyed my time with the M6P so far. They also look pretty cool. I got the \"clear\" option, and it's got a nice clean science fiction look to it. I like it.The M6P has several features that are worth noting as well. The last three or so inches of cords that go into the headphones themselves are made of a much stiffer material than the rest of the cord is. This \"memory wire\" is there is so you can mold them around your ear, making these headphones perfect to use while exercising or working. I have a physical job that allows me to listen to music while working, and these headphones have been incredibly nice for that. They rarely jostle or fall out. If you're looking for a good set of headphones for use while working out, these are ones I'd give serious consideration. The M6P also has an inline universal control that has a surprisingly large variety of uses for only having a single button, a volume slider, and a built-in microphone. The volume slider is incredibly nice as you don't have to fight to get your iPod/Mp3 player out of your pocket to adjust the volume. Same goes for the single button, which can be use for playing/pausing music and even skipping or restarting tracks depending on how you press it. The mic works pretty well for phone calls too. Overall, the inline universal control is a pretty convenient feature I rather appreciated. It's a pretty high-end feature that I've never had on any in-ear headphones before.The M6P comes in an attractive little box with plenty of accessories in addition to the headphones themselves. There's a really small zip-up case that carries other things in addition to the headphones. There's a really nice folded up users manual that is very helpful in getting acquainted with the product and its various features. There's also a small zip-lock baggy with several different types of rubbery ear tips you can switch out if the default ear-tips don't suit your fancy. I really appreciated the extra ear-tips, as each of the six pairs pretty much guarantees that, no matter what your ears are shaped like, you will be able to enjoy these headphones comfortably. That's great. There's also a little clip that can be used to attach the phones into your shirt or whatever, which is a nice feature that helps keep the pressure off your ears if the cord gets tugged a bit. Overall, a nice package.Truly, these are great headphones, but they're not without some quirks to consider. The memory wire, as great as it is for keeping the phones in your ears, makes it so the headphones take longer to put in than others would be. Once you put the earbuds in your ears, you'll want to make sure you won't need to take them out for a little while. I also found the memory wire a pain to struggle with right out of the box until they had broken in. The memory wire on the right-earbud on mine were particularly stubborn for a little while. Once broken in, however, the memory wire is very easy to make conform to your ears and wroks great. Finally, and this is admittedly a nitpicky gripe, I don't care for the plug-in jack myself. It is angled at 90', with an L-shape. I prefer straight plug-ins for headphones, but that's just my preference, and doesn't really take the quality of the phones down at all. None of these are issues that would keep me away from the M6P, mind you, but they are quirks to keep in mind.All things considered, these are fantastic headphones. I've been supremely surprised by their high quality in comparison to all the other in-ear headphones I've owned. I have friends with high-end in-ear headsets that were twice the price (or higher) as these, but in my opinion, the M6P is much higher quality in terms of sound and has a much more robust feature set. These are a pretty awesome deal at $40! It appears you can get them for even cheaper than that on Amazon too, which astounds me. I'd definitely give these a hearty recommendation at this price. They're a great set of headphones. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading.

Welcome to Live Chat Cisco Support for Linksys Products. How may I help you?from me:I purchased an e2000 router. I downloaded the firmware update and the update generated an error message in the middle of the update. I cannot reset the router or access it.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):Are you trying to install the router or trying to upgrade the firmware?from me:Upgrade the firmware.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):What's the current firmware running on the router?from me:Whatever came with the unit. I think it was version 6. Since I cannot access the router anymore, I can't give you more information.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):I am afgraid there is no version 6from me:Whatever came with the router your company sold.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):Who is your ISP (Internet Service Provider)?from me:The ISP is irrelevant.

Can you please connect me with 2nd level support?from Kashinath (46193) (privately):No, not possibel because we do the firmware upgrade when there is any issue like wireless disconnection or frequent disconnection or any other performcanc based issue with the router, as you are conencted to some other network, you need to be on wired computer to the router in order to download and upgrade the firmware and you donlt know the current firmware on the router, then how would you assume that the router has old firmware?from me:i purchased three of these, all configured the same way. I take them out of the box, connect them to the PC and download the current firmware first. The firmware that comes with it is build 6 created in January of 2010. The current version is 1.01-Build 7, which is what I downloaded. It worked fine for the other two. This one crashed and is now inaccessible.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):All E2000 router come with the latest firmware.from me:No they dont. The e2000 had 1.0.01 BUILD 6. If you go to your website, and look for firmware updates, the current version 1.01 BUILD 7. This is what I downloaded.from Kashinath (46193) (privately):So , download the 1.01 build 7 . So go to our website connect the computer to the routyer using a cable and then access the router web set up page and upgrade the firmwarehere is the link:[...]from me:You still don't understand, I downloaded the file you mentioned, the file did NOT correctly load onto your router and the router crashed.

I was listening to my music at a higher bit-rate compared to the nasty ole MP3s, so if you want to test the performance get a \"lossless\" format to test.

They are good for blocking some noise, my old Bose over-the-ear phones performed about the same.

I lay back and listened for over an hour, flipping through a variety of music, amazed at the sound and ability to become completely lost in the moment.What I'm getting at is that we have gone through an assortment of headphones over the years, headphones for Walkmans (if you don't know what they are they were the best thing before iPods... sort of) headphones for cheap plastic portable cassette players, portable CD players, and finally an assortment of bud earphones for all types of mp3 players and other portable devices. Many of these are poorly built, easily broken and a sorry excuse for listening to music.I forgot how good it can sound to have the music surround your ear in a full headphone and not ear buds. The music fills a bigger space in your head than most ear buds. But don't get me wrong, I have some ear buds that are wonderful including V-MODA R-ROUGE Remix In-Ear Headphones (Rouge) which I really, really like. There is a place for bud style headphones, like walking or hanging outside somewhere. It would be difficult to wear these headphones while taking a hike or riding a bike - even though they are lightweight and comfortable...Sound: I truly got lost listening with these headphones. The sound was so clear, very layered and I could imagine in my minds eye where every musician was standing and where every instrument was placed &#34;on stage&#34;. The bass was deep, the vocals crisp and it carried through from one genre to another. They block out most noise. I had them on next to a TV at regular volume and couldn't hear the TV at all while music was playing.Comfort: They were comfortable, very soft foam surround, maybe a little too much tension to keep them tight but I'm not sure there is a way around that with this style of headphones. I was lying down while listening but they stay firm when sitting up as well. The headband is soft and fabric covered so it doesn't catch in your hair.Appearance: They are sleek looking - a little bulky but sleek for this style of headphones. They come in a cool embellished box with a form fitting case.Extras: This set came with a case, two very sturdy audio cables, one has controls for iPod 3GS and up. It also works with my iPod Classic to control volume and pause. The connections for the cables are sturdy and well designed. There are two removable 'pockets' for storing the audio cables and a Carabiner just in case you wanted to clip your headphones somewhere for storage. There is also a 1/4&#34; adapter.Please visit my customer images to see some of the detailing and extras.The packaging says that these were designed to work with iPod but I'm sure they would work well for all components.I hope to find the time, away from two young children, to use these more and more.

These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away.

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;"}, {"review_id": "9b7fdc3406a9712673add5fba2ad2041", "review": "Purchased a few of these for a conference room at work, mainly because they were long enough and cheap enough.

The verdict is in- this cable is a very high quality cable which works beautifully with no problems at all.Despite it being thick and a little tricky since you can not bend it at a sharp angle, it is easy to work with by looping a bit as the 6+ft of cable gives us plenty of room to do so, but I would advise you to check out any holes in furniture or other small areas that the cords might have to pass through to be sure you have enough room to pass this cable through if there is any question- BEFORE you install it.We have checked this cable with various devices- PS3, HDTV, Blu-Ray player and most recently it is being used from a high quality amplifier to a very high level audio-visual computer system.  In all cases, the picture/sound has been top notch, with no disintegration of information flow or integrity of signal.The quality of this cable is definitely high and equals or surpasses the performance of cables that are much more expensive on the market but have brand names that people are more familiar with.  We have a LOT of cables and cords in our house as we have an electronic addict in our home, so we have a lot of HDMI cables and devices to test and compare with.  This cable is also a good choice for future equipment upgrading as it will be compatible.The frustration free packaging is brilliant, by the way.  Makes life a LOT easier!I highly recommend this cable, as long as you are not required to make a sharp angle for installation with no extra cord to loop around, or as long as your cable does not have to pass through a very tiny space (as is often the case when you have multiple cables running through holes in furniture, or other small spaces."}, {"review_id": "038700212d2bf8b2749728323a168b56", "review": "A little background ... when HD TVs became a big selling commercial product (4-5 years ago), it was a big \"profit center\" of businesses to give you a good deal on the TV, and charge ridiculous prices for HDMI cables.  \"You need this\" the big box salesman would say and then hand you a $30 or $40 package with a 3 or 6 foot HDMI cable - usually of dubious quality.  Many still do this, and some of the bigger high-discount box stores still have amazingly high prices on \"accessories\" for any audio or video equipment.Savvy consumers quickly learned that they could get a perfectly good HDMI cable for single digits, and an online cable business in the Los Angeles area has made a big business about selling excellent quality cables for small markups.Meanwhile, Amazon has also been a great source for third party companies selling good cables at steep discounts.  At the same time, Amazon has become involved in providing video content, so it makes sense for them to also provide their own products for watching those videos (assuming that your 7\" Kindle Fire screen is too small, lol).Just looking at these cables shows that Amazon is quite serious about the video business.  The smooth black plastic with the Amazon name/logo is covered with cellophane to keep it looking good for when you are ready to install the cable.  The plugs are relatively slim, so that they fit in situations where there are plugs above and below the HDMI jack.The Amazon Basics name on the cable itself, shows that even the raw cable supplier is making significant quantities specifically made for this product.Unfotunately, I cannot yet test the ethernet or other advanced capabilities of the cable, but it is certainly nice to know that it won't be necessary to buy a new cable later if I do upgrade.The cable clearly has tough and solid construction, without being overly thick and awkward to work with.I did try replacing the HDMI cable to my main living room 1080p screen with this cable and could not detect any difference.  Since the 3 year old cable was a top premium HDMI cable of its day, that is a very good recommendation for this product.Of course, the biggest selling point is the very inexpensive selling price of this cable.  Since it qualifies for Amazon's usual free shipping when included with other items to make up the minimum, it's hard to find any other HDMI cable of equal quality at this price."}, {"review_id": "5635c32a7e705a58f3d2d5a7e6a34616", "review": "Used three of these for some new TVs I purchased.

The apple ipad cover fell completely short of being something that holds the IPAD in a position that i'm comfortable with.  I like it raised slightly higher--gives better viewing and better ability to use the keyboard.Even the apple store guy said he did not like the limitations  of the ipad cover and recommended a leather cover alternative.I don't know how this will hold up in a year--but to me, the price was cheap enough that it doesn't matter if it falls apart in a year.  It seems like it will be durable though.While some might be comfortable using this cover while the IPAD is standing, I only like to use it in landscape mode.  It seems too unstable standing.You can not use the cover while docking the IPAD in a docking station, however, you can hook it up to the computer or charger without a docking station.I am happily returning the $40 apple IPAD cover and keeping this.  And strongly urging you to not hesitate to buy this.There is an elastic strap on the top corner, inside the cover, to keep the IPAD in place.  The snap that holds the cover closed, remains loose when the cover is open.  That bothers me slightly--just because i don't like the look of it that way.  The  Kick stand (for lack of a better word) is magnetized with what seems to be a sufficient enough magnet to hold it in place when you don't need to use it.With all of that said--I wouldn't pay $70 for this--then again, i can't imagine paying $70 for any IPAD cover.

Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form.  You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping.  The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit.  You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1.  Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see.  Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality.  I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2.  Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort.  If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed.  For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage.  It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for.  So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3.  These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug.  So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player.  This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4.  The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5.  Burn-in works with these.  Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed.  They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price.  The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y.  The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them.  Nice touch.They feel good, too.  Really good.  Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears.  And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great.  These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands.  Some of this really depends on your player, too.  Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem.  The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient.  I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case.  Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy.  The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues."}, {"review_id": "391e757d60ab1cf4c64c3d8198372c8d", "review": "These headphones have a tinny, weak sound, worse than the Apple earbuds that I had been using at work.

I use it daily for typical home use - web, music, email, viewing/editing documents, watching videos.The Good:+ Great performance+ Less power consumption (LED)+ Base tilts up+ VESA compliant so you can use a different stand or wall mount+ InexpensiveThe Bad:- The connections (VGA, DVI, and audio in) are a little difficult to access (although once you get them hooked up you can forget about them)- There is no HDMI connection- It is too bright at nightPerformance:I think that the performance (colors, contrast, brightness) is very good for home use - it looks great surfing the web, looking at pictures, or watching movies. Images and text are clear and crisp. 1080P video looks fantastic. Thanks to the LEDs it stays cool and consumes very little power.The blacks in movies and images look pretty good, vibrant colors from pictures are not washed out or too enhanced, and it is easy on your eyes even after multiple hours of viewing (during the day or in a well-lit room).  The one complaint I have is that even if you turn down the brightness to zero, at night in a dark room it is too bright. I wish the brightness could be turned down even more.Design:The base allows the monitor to tilt up which is nice, and it is VESA compliant so you can remove the base and hook it up to a wall mount or a multiple monitor mount.When trying to hook up the cables they are a little difficult to access - I had to tip the monitor down on it side to be able to get them connected.  Once everything is connected you won't have to worry about it.It does have built in stereo speakers which are OK, but similar to most built in monitor/tv speakers, they don't provide very good sound.  I have a cheap set of 2.1 channel computer speakers that I use that sound much better.Summary:Overall this is a great monitor for the price, and I would highly recommend it.

Overall, it appears to be a good case, though I have a number of quibbles with it. I have had the case only a few days, so these are initial impressions.Good stuff: The case fits the iPad 3 very well. It is a bit snug, perhaps; I have seen some reviewers complain about this, but I consider it to be an advantage. The auto-on-off switch, activated by a magnet when the case is closed, works just fine. My primary concern was that the case would hold the iPad securely, without slipping, especially when being used as a stand in the upright position. The case I bought for my original iPad failed in this regard. The new case, however, uses a velcro closure that feels very secure. It does not slide around in the case at all.Neutral stuff: The buttons on the side of the unit are not easy to reach, but that is more a function of the design of the iPad rather than the case. Exposing the buttons would require exposing more of the iPad, which would not be a good design decision (IMO). Be advised that while the product literature suggests that this case is made of leather, it isn't. I knew that when I purchased it, so that wasn't an issue for me. However, if anyone is led to believe that this is a leather case, be assured: it isn't. The case features a hand strap on the back of the flap, for use when the flap is folded around. I have not found a good way to use this flap, so I consider it a neutral feature. (YMMV) Finally, I have not used the stylus loop, and I don't plan to, so I have nothing to say in that regard (except that it successfully stays out of the way if you don't care to use it).Bad stuff: This case is heavy. I was surprised at how heavy it is. With the case, it gives up any gains in weight that it had over the original iPad; in fact, I believe the iPad 3 with this case weighs more than my iPad 1 in its case. This is only an issue when I am supporting the iPad in my hands, but it is noticeable at those times--and annoying. Also, this case smells. It has a chemical, fake-leather smell that is unpleasant and sticks to your hands. I expect that the smell will fade over time (I have used fake leather steering wheel covers in my car, and they have the same problem), but for now, it's yet another annoyance. Finally--and this is little more than a quibble--the angles at which the iPad sits when the case is used as a stand are not quite to my liking. The angle in the upright position is too steep, and the angle in the leaned-back position is too shallow.Summary: I gave this case four stars, and I would recommend it to a friend. Of course, I would inform him of the disadvantages that I have noted in the review. However, they do not outweigh the advantages of the case (again, IMO)."}, {"review_id": "d32bf600079165ce1c2e8c5a92e37785", "review": "Having bought the new Ipad, of course I want a protective case.

It also has a handle to support it with one hand.Having used the product for over a month I am very happy with it. All the buttons are accessible through the cutouts. One thing to do is make sure the flap that holds the ipad in on the edge with the full slot is velcroed tightly so it can't slip at all. The stand works well - I even just use the ipad in bed, sitting it right on my chest. The magnet system to sleep/wake the unit when the cover is opened or closed works perfectly. My only concern is that I see a slight tear at one of the hinges.  I don't think it will develop into a problem, so I give it 5 stars - obviously if it does not last my opinion will change.

I did not have that problem.Since the ipad and case are black, and the ipad works in any orientation it can take a bit of feeling to find the on-off button...I may stick a little colored sticker to make it obvious.

The interface issues I spoke of in my previous rating have been enhanced to include a search feature as well as more internet media options i.e. Hulu Pro etc. The one I would really like to see WD cut a deal with is Amazon. *Crosses fingers*You will likely have to do a couple of firmware updates, make sure you do them all, it really makes a difference.(They do take some time)I have had a couple of solid lock-ups, all you need to do is unplug the unit for a few seconds and plug it back in & you're off and running again. Don't take this wrong, it does not happen often and is definitely not a deal killer or anything; just nature of the beast. Just understand every now and then you need to re-boot it. Speaking of, an actual power button would be nice for this reason. (There is not one)So, highly recommend this product and Amazon had them on sale for $59.00 recently. *Presses Add-To-Cart*Happy Netflixing!"}], "B003NR57BY": [{"review_id": "cda746d13e0221f7625e497a968bd42a", "review": "The ergonomics of this mouse are pretty good and setup was simple.My only complaint is it doesn't seem to like certain surfaces.

Every other mouse I've used has been \"flat\" on that side, which is why the M510 feels so different, perhaps a bit small, in my hand.I use a \"fingertip\" or \"claw\" grip on my mouse, and this mouse is better suited for a \"palm\" grip, or possibly someone with smaller hands.

My first impressions upon taking it out of the box were that it looked different than the pictures shown. After comparing it to the product pictures I confirmed that what I ordered was a slightly different unit than what is shown. I have posted a picture so that you can see what is different in the one I ordered compared to the original product picture & the pictures of other owners. Specifically: The USB dongle is full size, not a mini like in others pictured. The buttons below the touch pad are completely different than other pictured models. Keys are also flat & clear glossy finger print magnet plastic material, not convex matte finish like seen in other models pictured.After trying this product out for a little over 20 mins navigating the internet and doing some video playback my first impressions are that I should have invested in another (but full size) keyboard. The biggest problem I have with this product is that it will go into some sort of sleep mode (I assume to conserve battery life) which takes about 10 seconds before it will reconnect with the computer and start showing the mouse swipes & keyboard inputs. This was very frustrating while surfing the net & watching YouTube videos. I have no idea the length of time before it would power down the signal but just to give you an idea this would happen after watching a 2 min YouTube video.At first I thought it was neat how small the keyboard was but after trying to type on it I've grown frustrated with typing on the thing. Having been raised knowing how to type on the keyboard I find myself being frustrated going from 70+ wpm on the computer down to about 10 wpm because of design of this particular keyboard. The keys are grid shaped, not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys. So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys.Lastly, & probably the most important is signal quality. I purchased this with intentions of using it for an HTPC. Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it drops keystrokes about every 5th input. The trackpad is also something highly left to be desired. I first used this on my gaming machine that I sit about 2 ft away from and noticed a slight laggy input when using the trackpad. I was a little leery that the signal was that bad sitting so close to the input but I decided to still give it a chance and plugged it into my HTPC. Increasing the distance between the USB dongle & the keyboard only increases the lag of using the trackpad.So in review: 1 star was taken off for not receiving exactly what I was shown in the product pictures. 1 star was taken off for the poor signal quality of this item even at close ranges, and 1 star is taken off for the lack of distance this allows you to have between the PC and the keyboard (in the product description it states this works within 30M which I assume they mean 30 meters. Unfortunately in a 12x12 room with nothing between me and the PC I was having signals cut out constantly. This room also has no wireless internet connection & no wireless phones)."}, {"review_id": "978688baf9a479cad16a45c4df06b71f", "review": "Light and manageable.

Also missing is a scroll wheel which would have been a wonderful addition (I would trade of the laser). It also seems to me that the missing function keys cold have been implemented using a shift or alt of the normal F-keys.

After the first charge, I was able to use it for almost 2 months before I needed to charge it again. And now, 3 years later, I only charge it about once a month.

I decided to order these speakers and take my music and videos to \"the next level\" and see if these speakers could deliver the loud, clear, and rich sound I expect from more expensive stereo systems and speakers.Below are my positive and negative evaluations of the Logitech Z623 speaker system.Positive:- The subwoofer is huge, and provides a nice, rich, bass sound. I am amazed at the loudness and clarity of the bass.- The speakers may seem little, but they produce a big and rich sound, with very little vibration or feedback.- The overall sound quality and clarity is impressive. When I listened to my favorite songs, I heard sounds and instruments I had never heard before. Watching videos with these speakers has opened up an entirely new (and great) listening experience!- To test the unit's power, I turned the volume on full blast (with the computer volume turned on full as well) and the sound was pretty much flawless.  I didn't hear any rattling or feedback. These speakers are pretty loud, and definitely loud enough for what I need.Negative:- The cords are a little short, but not too short as to be annoying.- The unit is large (the entire set weighs about 22 lbs). This means that moving the speakers and subwoofer is a little inconvenient. I am used to moving speakers around with my laptop. I really can't do this with these speakers.Overall, this is a great speaker system, and I am glad I upgraded from the cheap speakers. Until now, I didn't know what I was missing using cheaper speakers. I plan on using these speakers any time I watch a video, listen to music, or play games.

I've had it for six months and the sound still sounds the same meaning the quality did not degrade, but there is a minor problem. Every time I do turn on the speaker, it makes a loud static noise which is annoying. Not sure if it's a product defect or if all speakers go through this phase. I've had this problem since the 4th month and was seeing if it persisted for a while and it seems like it's likely to be permanent. I have also never played shifted the &#34;Volume&#34; knob more than halfway.

This is a comfortable, accurate gaming mouse with a relatively short battery lifespan.  That being said, I love this mouse.I have a skinny hands with long fingers.  This mouse fits me perfectly.  There's a slight learning curve for the thumb buttons.  However, I was hitting them perfectly within the first hour.  The contour of the index finger buttons makes them especially familiar immediately.  I have always preferred the contour of a Logitech mouse so none of this surprises me.In terms of tracking it works great, as it should.  I use a Razer Exactmat speed surface so I predicted and received flawless tracking.  Unfortunately I haven't tested this on any other surface so I can't comment.Others feel the battery life is poor.  It seems to last three hours while gaming.  I couldn't care less.  Leaving the cord plugged into a USB port and sitting on the desk is simple.  I've always had a corded mouse so it doesn't upset me to play while it charges.Weight has been a posted concern.  I tested the mouse at the local electronics shop first and liked it.

I don't think it's heavier than it needs to be for a solid, positive movement and I can use it for hours, even corded without strain.- The 13 buttons can be programmed for 5 different profiles - Using Setpoint 5.44.5 works like a charm. The tactile feel of them is fine for my needs. I would prefer less of clicking noises using left / right and center mouse buttons.- Finishing is great matte black - less cheesy than the G500 or other \"gaming mice\". Probably a Con for ppl that like showing off, but...- User replaceable AA rechargeable Eneloop battery.- You can charge it while you use it. The \"wired\" mode transition is seamless - at least with the drivers I've used -  but some reviewers disagree on that. Setpoint 5.44.5 on Win 7 64bit never produced a freeze or loss of settings while hot-plugging the USB cable while the mouse was used.- Matte finish easy to grip. Feels \"different\" than the normal rubber padded mice, but will probably last longer too. Grip is quite positive, no concerns.- Includes USB extension cable for wireless receiver - more of a desktop user easement. Range is great for laptop use, works out to 3 feet / 1 meter easily, never had need for more.CONS:- Big, not ideal for slipping it in your laptop's slim carrying messenger bag, but nothing terrible. &lt;- actually I do carry it around in my slim messenger belkin, but that's me...- Noisy clicks...I would prefer it more subtle for \"stealth\" gaming. Hard for someone to miss what you are doing with loud blazing clicks when in the heat of battle!- Charge only via powered USB port (well, I wouldn't like to drag a docking station around, so, no biggie)- Slightly elevated slope might be uncomfortable to some - definitely not a \"claw\"-grip. Works Ok with my middle-sized hands.- Does not include a unifying nano-receiver (guess the \"G series\" nano provides faster response? nothing i can feel tho)- Battery life is nothing to talk home about, but not terrible, and you can replace it almost on the fly (or hook the USB cable). On par or better with most high performance mice, that are tied to Li-Ion proprietary battery packs.This review follows almost 3 weeks after the mouse has been purchased.Main thoughts -- Productivity PerformanceUsed the G700 in a variety of applications, mainly design programs and games. The 5 available profiles work a charm and you can program the driver to \"sense\" the application's .exe and switch profiles on the fly: switching between say - Autodesk Revit and SketchUp to Adobe Illustrator and back for copy-pasting etc, the software follows you switching profiles seamlessly, altering assigned macros for the thumb / side buttons. Each profile can have it's own DPI setting and DPI steps that you can then hard-set on the fly on the mouse. The profiles are stored on the mouse's internal mem-bank too, so you take those settings with you to use on multiple PCs.- Gaming PerformanceThe real performance difference is in games tho, where you really feel the increase in precision despite the dpi used - I doubt that people can positively utilize more than 2000dpi on their mice, with me finding a limit close to the 1600dpi. Above that you cannot be precise enough for anything but laid back internet browsing.I do play MMOs (EVE online), where the extra buttons can do macros etc just fine but precision is not that critical. In the more demanding FPS world, the mouse clearly shines. To be honest I've never had complains on the responsiveness of the VX Nano or the Microsoft's Mobile 4000, yet the G700 beats them on all surfaces. Almost any cheap cloth mouse-pad (used it on black and grey) did improve the feel of it over bare desktop surfaces.Tracking while you snipe is great, and sensitivity is easily adjusted by the default keys left of your right index finger. You can customize the dpi switching to be assigned to any key, with +/- steps in independent keys or looping through the settings with just one key.The \"extra\" G keys have a positive feel and I personally found them quite easy to find and identify just with touch. Unlike other reviewers, I did like the thumb keys and I can use them each and every time without missing or guessing. All of them work for both a slight \"upward/in\" movement of the thumb, or direct depression. Did not run into locking problems when using more than 2-3 buttons at a time (speaking on coms, using assigned macros and/or firing etc).Response is great and you cannot tell between wired and wireless.- Side status LEDs3 triangle LEDs live on the left side of the G700. With 3x primary colors, indicate the profile in use in case you manually switch(orange - 5 steps), DPI used (Red, 5 steps) and battery life (Green, 3 steps, with a single Red coming on when battery is really low).- More on the sensor's DPI ratingRemember tho that most \"common\" optical mice dance around the 800-1000 dpi range, and with today's screen real-estate (typical 1920x1080) and dual screen configs being  common, many times you need to move a 800dpi mouse along your mouse-pad and even lift/return it for some more to go from one edge to the other. The software allows you to set 5 dpi steps for each profile, and I have none going above 3200 dpi (nor did the factory settings).- BatteryThe mouse comes with a single Sanyo Eneloop battery, and typically lasts about 2 days of work/gaming. Keep in mind that I do use my computer at least 10 hours a day, so I am happy with that. Charging usually completes within 3-4 hours while in use. Never timed it tho. The \"low battery\" indicator does come up on your screen, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's too conservative and you do have at least a couple of hours - or more - of usage after the warning.Personally I would prefer 2x AA batteries in parallel (like with the M705 marathon) for better battery life. Also keep in mind that despite the fact that the Eneloop is one of the highest quality NiMH batteries out there, their rated capacity is 1900-2000mAh, while most high capacity AA NiMH are rated around 2500-2700mAh. I tend to believe that the Eneloops would shine on low-drain, long battery life applications, something the G700 is clearly not. I don't have a spare 2700mAh (I use them in my flash units), but I believe the G700 would be better paired with such cells.- Corded use and chargingAgain, the transition from wireless to wired mod was seamless in my experience and the latest drivers.The cord is not the softest around, but I never felt it \"stiff\" and uncomfortable as some reported. It's an ok cord. Not as soft as many silicon-skinned cords some mice used, but works fine for me.The USB wire connector utilizes a micro-USB male plug on the G700's end. That means that any such cable could work for both using and charging the mouse. For the latter, probably any 5V mobile phone charger would work  too, for those who desperately need an off-USB charging device (many PCs do power their USBs when in sleep mode, so charging is happening even when the machine is not \"on\"). Micro USB is supposed to be the EU standard for cell phone charging since 2010 (Apple, Nokia, Samsung, LG, Motorola etc among others agreed on using it universally) so more and more devices will provide compatible chargers.- Why the G700? So many Mice out there!As I was mostly on the move, I do appreciate wireless mice, and I've been spoiled by the nano-receiver on my Logitech VX Nano for more than 2 years now. The thing is simply amazingly versatile and quite fool-proof (not in a few occasions people had damaged the  dongle, destroyed a USB port or both due to them protruding in the wrong place at a wrong time.Since I've bought the VX nano, I've used a couple of mice on friends computers and/or tried some on mine. I did not fail to notice that the old generation Laser \"848nm\" sensor they VX Nano and most of the nano-receiver mice Logitech produced the last few years (V220, M505, M705) did lack in tracking precision, even against relatively cheaper competitors like the Microsoft Mobile 4000 mouse - a unit that if it wasn't for the extremely jerky/cheap feel of its wheel/center button would be almost perfect for the &lt;$20 price many vendors sell it for.Since I liked the Hyper-Fast scroll wheel in my VX nano, but I've hated the fact that the center mouse button was not on the wheel, the main contenders for replacing it where all full scaleLogitech mice, which provided all of:* Hyper-scroll wheel + center mouse button with positive feel* Better tracking than the VX nano* Ideally wireless with nano-receiver.* At least 2-3 programmable buttons, but not as badly placed as on the VX Nano.* Not really expensive - I ended up buying on the high end of my budget but most competitive \"gaming\" mice offered less features for the same price.The G700 was chosen over:- The G500 - seemed a great mouse, but cheesy in appearance and not really cheaper in the long run especially since it's only wired.- The Performance MX. Relatively better battery life, but not that better (still a high precision sensor with only one AA battery), not cheaper, less buttons (that many will not use anyways), with a unified nano receiver. I believe it would be a great alternative if it was actually cheaper. Has the \"glass capable\" dark field technology, but I never planned on using it on glass.- G400/300 - only wired, cheap(er) feel, great tracking. Don't like the right side buttons on the G300.Anywhere Mouse MX: All the pros of the VX nano, and all the cons too, but the 2 side buttons placement. Nothing a VX nano owner will actually want, unless you have to use it on glass and/or really need a unified receiver to use with a keyboard or something.- M705 \"Marathon\" mouse: Did not promise better tracking, but would give great autonomy and a definitely better battery life. Unifying receiver, way better scroll wheel than the nano-mice - if you care for middle clicking...off center sensor etc where never annoyances for my game style.6 month Update:After 6 months with the G700, I have nothing more to say that it still feels a great buy. I use it daily for design/drafting and gaming. Battery life is mediocre, but will easily last 20 or so hours of use in my hands. The matte finishing still looks great, with only a hint of skin grease visible on the left button. G keys never missed a beat thus far. Wish it had a unifying receiver to be perfect (ended up getting a K series unified keyboard for my laptop and I get to use 2x USB ports just for input devices).9 month Update:Rock and solid in every department other than battery life. Tried an old GP 2700mAh and still the mouse needs to be plugged every other day the most - and I am not using it @ 1000 reports /sec for productivity tasks which is 90%+ of the hours it is used. Got used to it, but Logitech should definitely consider a 2x AA design for the next flagship mouse, even if they come up with reduced consumption components."}, {"review_id": "da0d6de88f8581469e3d9fd6f3785ecf", "review": "I really do feel like this mouse was designed from the ground up just for me! I have always been a fan of thumb buttons since my first mouse that had them, the original Microsoft Intellimouse explorer. This has 4 thumb buttons, that are easy to use, and in the perfect spot for me. All of the buttons are easy to access, and fully programmable. Overall, it it very comfortable, and I love the thumb rest. This is the mouse I would have designed for myself.I use it for playing World of Warcraft, and while the game does not directly recognize any buttons beyond the first 5, you can program and macro the rest of the buttons, giving you very quick access to lots of stuff.I also really like the scroll wheel. Being able to switch between free scrolling and normal scrolling is great. I like free scrolling while web surfing, it lets me get to the bottom of a page very quickly, but free scrolling sucks in games, because your camera view can be accidentally moved very easily. The button for switching scrolling modes is right behind the scroll wheel, making mode switching super easy and quick. My cordless 620 had the mode switch underneath, which was a bit of a pain.The build quality is excellent, the rechargeable battery included is of the best quality, and the finish texture gives a secure grip.I tend to be very critical and picky, but so far the only slight cons I have with it is, its a bit heavy. It does move well though. The price is a bit steep, but I have no regrets so far."}, {"review_id": "d57f818555ad57237bc42491c86d7a66", "review": "The Logitech G700 gaming mouse is by far one of the most desirable mice I have ever owned. I had upgraded from a 6 year old Logitech Performance Lazer mouse, which still works for the most part, but some of the buttons are hit and miss. A lot of the functionality and the like for the G700 have already been reviewed in the comments so I won't bore you with repeated like to like reviews. What I will be focusing on is it's battery life in fine detail.The Logitech G700 comes with a 1.2v AA 1,900 mAh eneloop brand rechargeable battery. It is rated, according to the manual and double checked by Logitech support team, that the mouse can function on a full charge with continual use between 8-10 hours of battery life. That's right ladies and gentlemen. A retailed value Logitech mouse of $99 will last you 8-10 hours on a full charge with its included battery. Ridiculous you say? Well you are spot on. One could easily spend $20 bucks on a cheap mouse on any brand and get 2-3 months of battery life. Sure it would not have the Logitech label on it, would not have the 13 programmable buttons and some other fancy stuff but bottom line you would not have to recharge the battery every day, or even every week with a mouse rated to run 2-3 months on a single battery. So lets just come to realization that the battery life on this mouse is extremely awful, probably the worst I have ever seen in the history of wireless mice. While talking to the Logitech support team they stated its comparable, the Logitech MX Performance mouse, lasts up to 30 days on a single charge. Why the HUGE difference in battery life? Well according to the Logitech support team both mice have the exact same rechargeable battery. So again I ask myself why does the G700 only last 8-10 hours on 1 full charge and the MX Performance lasts 30 days on one charge and they both contain the same battery? What is destroying the battery life on the G700? What drains it so quickly? The Logitech support team had no direct response and made the excuse that because the G700 has more buttons and it's a gaming mouse that it drains the battery faster and this answer was from an assistant manager after I got fed up with the international gentlemen who had to look up every question and was hard to understand. I call BS on that answer I really do. So I decided to go out and do some testing...I went out and purchased the Logitech MX Performance mouse so I could compare the two. I also decided to purchase a pack of eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh to see if truly this G700 really has an awful battery life or I just got a bad battery. In theory I should be able to get roughly 4 more hours of battery life with an extra 800 mAh if this battery truly only has a running battery time of 8-10 hours on a single charge using its stock battery giving me an estimated run time of 12-14 hours. After further testing the Logitech MX Revoltuoin triumphs the G700 in battery life by far using the eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh on both mice. So again the question remains why does the G700 chew and spit out battery life in a matter of hours VS the MX Revolution lasts a full month on a single charge? I did some research and found that gaming mice naturally have a higher polling rate (ping rate) and they just hog battery juice from their internals because they require more power for more precision and less lag time. Plus gaming mice are for the most part are wired, not wireless and there are reasons for that because of the power gaming mice require to function at their best. What does this gibberish polling rate mean? Basically speaking its how many times your G700 talks to your computer. For example if your polling rate is set to 1000Hz then your G700 is updated every 1 millisecond. That means your G700 and your computer talk 1000 times per second. That's a lot of talking which means a heavy load on your battery. However if you change it to the lowest setting for the G700 which is 125Hz then your G700 only updates every 8 milliseconds which is 125 times per second which is a lot less talking which means less battery consumption. What does this all mean to the average user? Well if your not a hardcore gamer where every millisecond counts on your life then your in luck and should be able to get up to a couple days of battery life on a single charge depending on your average usage. Please note the below instructions are for getting the longest battery life out of your G700 and may not be up to snuff with your gaming needs. Here is how to do it...1. When your G700 is NOT in use toggle the On/Off switch underneath it to \"OFF.\" This way your G700 is not always trying to ping your computer even if it is not being used.2. Install the Logitech Gaming Software for your G700 from the Logitech website and set some settings. Set the polling rate to 125Hz. This is the best setting for using less battery juice. Also set the \"Advanced\" settings to \"Power Save\" which will put your mouse to sleep quicker when idle resulting in less consumption of battery juice in case you forgot to toggle your On/Off switch.3. Get a better mAh battery. Logitech threw in a common 1,900 mAh battery which is normal but stupid on their part since the gaming mouse beats it's battery to a pulp. Go out and upgrade your battery to a 2,700 mAh battery. For those who don't know mAh is basically the capacity of your battery. In most cases the higher the mAh the more capacity on name brands minus some fine fine details. However If you go and buy a higher mAh with Chinese writing all over it on some shady website chances are it's a cheap imitation and like all cheap imitations they are...well cheap and expect them to work half as good or less than a name brand.Because of the below average support from the Logitech support team as well as the lesser capacity battery included where a higher capacity battery was obviously needed I took away 2 stars. I would of taken 3 stars off if I had paid the full retail price but I was able to price match Amazon.com at my local retail store and got it to a more reasonable and comfortable price. I hope my review educated you and most importantly helped you achieve greater battery life then you ever thought possible on your Logitech G700 Gaming Mouse.

I might have appreciated a rubberized feel to the sides of this mouse rather than the textured hard plastic, but it's just as effective.This mouse lost a star due to a couple annoyances I have.First off, this does not use the Logitech universal receiver that the company uses for other wireless keyboards/mice. It's receiver polls at a much higher frequency. This paired with the fact that the mouse runs off of one AA NiMH battery, means the battery life is pretty abysmal; few hours at most. They've cleverly designed the charging cable to turn the mouse into a cabled variant which is convenient, but I now find myself almost exclusively using the mouse in this way rather than via wireless which defeats the purpose.Secondly, I lift my mouse off the mat while using it quite often. It's a habit I've had for 15 years or so. When I do that with this mouse, I almost always push one or two of the bottom thumb buttons. It's been enough of a problem that I've had to manually set these buttons to do nothing in games and the Logitech software (it would affect the DPI of the mouse). This probably won't affect twitch gamers or anyone else that doesn't have this habit though."}, {"review_id": "9a3e6dac1bb2dacebb0547f58b735bd6", "review": "This mouse is excellent for gaming.

At first I thought the smaller flatter keys would make my typing a lot less accurate because its harder to feel out individual keys but I actually type a lot better on this keyboard! The F and J keys have raised bumps on them to help you find where you need to put your pointer fingers.  I love the full-sized backspace key (my old keyboard had a tiny one) but I wish it also had a raised bump on it to find it easier. The capslock key has a tiny green light to indicate it is active but the scroll and numlock keys do not have indicators.On the top of the keyboard are media keys - to adjust the volume on the right side, and play/forward/backward on the left side. The F keys double as hotkeys via the FN key next to the right-side alt. There are keys to open your browser, media player, and even restart your pc! On the right side there are even more useful keys! keys for going forward and backward in your browser, opening your bookmarks menu, and opening the calculator. the calculator key is really handy for me as I do my math homework online, and i love that it is right above the number pad!The keyboard is pretty big and has a ledge on the bottom to rest your wrists on I guess. My keyboard tray is a bit small so I would prefer if the keyboard did not have this ledge! I keep my keyboard at an angle and it is just inconvenient. This is really my only complaint about the keyboard! Everything else is great.OH! one last thing to mention about the keyboard is that the keys are nestled tightly on the board so its a lot harder to get crumbs stuck in there! That's a definite plus for me because I have major night eating habits..The Mouse:the mouse is not tiny but also not huge. It is very basic, two buttons and a scroll wheel. It fits very comfortably in my small hands. I've used it both right handed and left handed and its very ergonomic! It only runs well if you have it on a mousepad, which is my only complaint because with other mouses I've used they have worked fine without a mousepad on my keyboard tray. But on the mousepad it runs very smoothly and comfortably.Overall I think this is a great combo! I bought it at Fry's and there was a rebate, so I think I paid $30? for it. I normally do not buy expensive keyboards because I tend to break them a lot..But this combo is definitely worth it. Its of great quality and very sturdy. I drop both components all the time and have not ever even experienced lag!I just want to edit this review to say that the keyboard has lasted 1000000000000000 times longer than any other keyboard I've owned. It is covered in nail polish and many parts are melted from spilling acetone on it. The paint on many keys has rubbed off from greasy and acetone covered fingers. The media button for going to the previous song got something sticky trapped around it so it is pretty much unusable. I have thrown this keyboard on the floor and across the room probably a thousand times. It falls off my keyboard tray onto my chair or the floor just about every time i get up. It sometimes does become unresponsive for as much as a minute at a time, which is unbearable. I hit it furiously when that happens. Crumbs HAVE managed to find their way through the cracks between the keys but its cool. I really think this keyboard is great for what I put it through.The mouse is in...gently used...condition.

I could always get some kind of map off the Internet or stop at triple-A and get directions, and once I got close, drive around until I found whatever it was we were looking for. Sure, sometimes I'd drive by the place four times before figuring out that was it. Sure, I'd end up in the wrong part of town at a bad (dark) time of day. Sure, sometimes we'd have to run to catch the start of a concert or to not lose our restaurant reservation. But that's all part of the \"fun\", right?Not anymore.Garmin Nuvi takes care of all that. With updated, always current, always correct lifetime maps, it always gets me where I'm going in plenty of time. Unlike a map, it not only tells me where we're going, but it gives me suggestions and directions, like \"stay right\" or \"take the SECOND exit\". The programming and operation is easy, with just a little three-page manual to tell you all you need to know to utilize all of the Nuvi's features. The big screen is highly readable and understandable. And as far as I can tell so far, as long as you put in the correct address, it knows how to get there. I even kind of like the sensible female voice (someone told me her nickname is \"Terrible Tammy\" - I don't know). This unit is desirable because it not only comes with lifetime maps, it comes with all the cords and accessories you need to get it up and running. I have only two small gripes: The map downloading process is painfully, excruciatingly slow. I know I don't have the fastest computer in the world, but it isn't doorstop material yet, either, but the overall software installation, map download, map verification, and loading onto the Nuvi took very close to two and a half hours. Make sure you update well in advance of any planned trip. (I suggest starting it at bedtime the night before.) The other gripe is that the suction cup mount really needs to be completely free of dirt and the windshield where you are attaching it sparkling clean. Any kind of residue on the glass or grit on the suction cup is going to send your Nuvi to the floor, where mine has been four or five times already. Even with those two nits, this is a device that exceeded my expectations and has made travel more, not less, pleasurable.

I simply don't trust the Garmin in unfamiliar areas.I bought the 1450LMT so I could monitor traffic during my daily hour-long commute, but I've found that both of the traffic apps on my phone give me much better traffic info than does the Garmin.I had been using saved routes to work around the poor navigation on the 1450, but the latest firmware update has made the routes function much more bothersome to use.I still gave the 1450s 3 stars, because the display is good (easier to read than a smartphone!), although I should note that my wife's 1450 developed a circular dead spot about 3/8 inch in diameter after only a year.  The voice directions are clear and generally timely.  The maps are pretty good, and they do get updated.Bottom line, I'm done with Garmin until they figure out how to route efficiently and correctly.  Sad that a company once a technology leader could fall so far behind the industry."}], "B003ZYF3LO": [{"review_id": "824ca1a6d15f8c7b56899d574d4ac6af", "review": "Before people start freaking out I am not comparing this to a Canon 1DX when I mention \"PRO\" in the review title, rather, that I use this consumer targeted camera for a very specific professional task.  I own 4 of these \"kits\", basically the D3100 and the 18-55 lens.  My company does high volume photography, mostly sports, schools and events (we will photograph over 90,000 kids this year) and I thought I would give these a shot to see how they would hold up for some of my basic sports portraits shoots and I am pleasantly surprised.  Make note of the word PORTRAITS after sports, we do not use these for action.I actually compared this, side by side, shot by shot with the Canon T2i when deciding which way to go since I was going to be purchasing so many of them.  It was actually a pretty big decision since I was deciding on a Nikon camera when my personal camera is a Canon 7D.  When comparing the 2 cameras I literally set them up on tripods right next to each other, took shots in the exact same settings, conditions, etc.  First, I compared everything in Manual mode, then I let the camera do the work in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority and full Program Mode.  Without running through every single shot I can simply say the Nikon D3100 beat the Canon t2i, much to my surprise.  This was a VERY close comparison and, in the end, the price of the Nikon helped tip the scale in that direction.Image QualityThe D3100 wins here.  How, you say, is that possible?  The Canon is 18 megapixel and the Nikon is only 14.2...true, but Nikon has a secret weapon, the 18-55 lens!  Believe it or not, the 18-55 Nikon lens, the KIT lens that comes on this camera and many others, is actually one of the sharpest images Nikon makes.  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't taken hundreds of shots, blown them up to 100% and compared them side by side.  Now, if you are looking for something where you plan to change lenses from time to time, then the Canon is the better choice.  However, in the case of my very specific needs, where I will never need to change out the lens on this camera because it is for sports portrait shoots only, you cannot beat the D3100.  I actually chose the Canon for another area of my business out of state where I needed more durability and flexibility...more on that in another review.As with any product, it will ultimately boil down to how you plan to use it.  If you are a consumer who is just getting into Digital SLR cameras, this is a great way to start.  It is cheap and it takes great images.  It has video, which is nice, although I do not use it so I can't give an in depth review of that functionality.  Make sure that you get the kit with the 18-55 lens though, that makes a big difference in image quality.It also has a great little feature that would be really helpful to beginners trying to understand how Aperture works.  It has a little animation on the LCD screen that shows an actual camera iris opening or closing as you adjust the aperture, which is helpful for beginners trying to understand the lower number being a bigger aperture concept.So, to sum it up:PROS:Price: You can't beat it, if you watch Amazon closely you will be able to catch it in the $500 range or maybe a bit less if you are luckyImage Quality:  Really amazing image quality WITH the 18-55 lens especially.Good for Beginners:  Has some really good tutorials to help beginners understand the basics of DSLR.Great \"Auto\" settings:  Produces really nice images on many of the standard settings for Shutter and Aperture Priority and full Program.  (although I recommend to beginners to try to learn how to shoot in Manual mode at least to understand how it works and NEVER use any of the silly settings like \"Sports\" or the other ones.)CONS:Not very tough:  It feels a lot cheaper than the CanonReally small:  It looks ridiculous with an SB900 flash on it!  (This is a con for me but might be a pro for others)Overall, I definitely recommend it for a beginner or someone with a very specific professional need like I have.  It earns 5 stars for how I use it."}, {"review_id": "0eb0dba352742b888bc904296f416af2", "review": "I learned photography in the early 1970's on a 35mm Miranda Sensorex SLR.  Lost interest in the hobby for a long time, then got back into it in 2009.  Wow, have things changed!  I have been using a Panasonic LX3 since December 2009 with very good results (fast Leica glass on the LX3) and was ready to get back into an interchangeable lens camera.  After doing a lot of hands on research, I decided on the D3100.I've had mine for two weeks now and for the most part, I am impressed.  The D3100 takes excellent images on automatic with the kit lens.  Composition is much easier with a proper viewfinder and the larger sensor makes obtaining shallow depth of field simple.  My semi-pro photographer friends have all commented that my images with the D3100 are more creative, more artistic and much better than with the LX3.Personally, I can see the enhanced creativity in my D3100 images but I feel there is little difference in image quality between the two cameras.  A bit of a disappointment on that regard (I was hoping for sharper images)  but others who have viewed my images disagree with me, so maybe I am being overly critical.  One thing I have discovered is the D3100's abilities far exceed mine when I take it off automatic - in other words, there is a steep learning curve going manual on this camera.  I have a lot to learn about exposure so I feel that the D3100 will be a great tool to help me enhance my photographic skills.I am a bit disappointed in the build quality - the SD card door is flimsy and moves around a bit when closed, the lens creaks.  The all metal LX3 has much better build quality than the D3100.  To be fair, the D3100 has better build quality than the Canons I tested.The D3100 feels great in my hands and is very nice to use.  The ergonomics are perfect.  I tested the D5100 and the D90 as well as all the Canon Rebels.  Of all of them, the D3100 felt the best.I considered getting the D5100 for its better sensor and screen, but the actual real world price difference was $400  (D5100 was being sold above sticker, D3100 was sold to me with a $100 Nikon rebate and an additional 10% discount from the retailer) and that was a significant savings.The 230k screen is adequate, not great, but acceptable.Overall, I am pleased.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the most out of this camera and I definitely feel it will help me grow as a photographer.Update, 6/1/11:  After reading Bryan Peterson's \"Understanding Exposure\", I am now shooting on full manual controls with my D3100.  I set shutter speed, aperture, ISO and white balance for every shot.  I also purchased the superb Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens and a Tamron 70-300 telephoto zoom lens.  With my newly acquired knowledge about setting exposure, the images I am taking with the D3100 are excellent.  Images taken with the prime lens are tack sharp, that lens is amazing.  The Tamron set to 70 mm also takes sharp images (images taken with the Tamron at 70 mm are sharper than the kit lens and the Tamron does not get soft until 300mm).  With just a little post processing (I am using the View NX software that came with the camera), I can get the images from the kit lens to look incredible.  I am extremely satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it."}], "B0040JHVC2": [{"review_id": "b6f219e8272c8f930aa8dc78d5a84e76", "review": "Like many people I spent nearly three months trying to determine which camera to purchase. I looked at the Nikon D90 and D7000; as well as, the Canon T2i. In the end I felt the best value was the Canon 60D. I could go on and on about the camera but most importantly I can say I'm very happy with my decision. This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the cameras but for me it came down to pixels, pentaprism, autofocus, LCD, and price. I have always been a Canon guy (A1, two Rebels) but this was my first digital and I was open to either company. In the end my view was that Canon is a better value at the lower end and Nikon is a better product at the high end.In terms of my decision to go with the 60D over the T2i I just felt that the extra features were going to get me better pictures and ultimately make me happier in the long term. These cameras are big so while the Rebel is smaller it is still a substantial camera with the lens on it. You have to be committed to carrying around a camera of this size. From a price perspective, the 60D was an additional $200. That gets you a better view finder and better focusing. These two things can make a huge difference between getting the best possible picture.Having used a high end film camera since I was 15 I find the controls to be very intuitive. There is a lot there so it will still take me some time to learn all the features but I'm able to get off and running very quickly. When you look at the reviews most of the issues are overstated. The majority of pictures with this camera will be taken in one of the standard shooting modes. The rest of the settings are nice to have but are hard to fiddle with when you are just concentrating on getting pictures taken of a brithday or a sporting event. There's one rule that seems to stand the test of time - the 80-20 rule. 80% of the people will use 20% of the functionality of this camera. The other 20% may use 80% but it will be less than 20% of the time.Lastly, I wouldn't get too caught up with the lenses either. This is a good all around lens if you can have only one lens. Again, 80% of the people will rarely change a lens. There are better lenses but most of us just won't notice the difference. I do believe that image stabilization is a must. In my mind it is the single biggest benefit to the average user. Sure some lenses focus faster or are better in low light but most of us can just hold down the shutter and use a flash.Get the camera and have some fun. There will be plenty of time to upgrade lenses, flashes, etc. You'll never be able to get back the pictures you miss."}], "B00413PHDM": [{"review_id": "c75ec2ac7c93e81116c12d71cae565aa", "review": "The picture on this monitor is very nice and there were no dead pixels.

I especially liked the simple remote control which is not overwhelming. However the wireless connectivity was a little difficult and very finicky. The wireless router is located about 20 feet away, and we've never had any problem conencting with laptops or iPhones/iPods. However, I had to fidget with the placement of the Roku and attempted 2-3x before connecting finally. It then downloaded an update and after it rebooted, it lost the wireless connection again. So I fidgeted with the placement again until it connected. Then I tried to setup NetFlix and the wireless had dropped again, so I reconnected, got the activitation code and it validated the Roku box. Thankfully, you cannot turn the Roku off so hopefully once it's connected, it stays connected or tries to reconnect. I am hoping it was just the initial setup that was slightly flakey. To be on the safe side, I made sure the wireless router and the Roku had as few electronic obstacles around it. I am very impressed with the streaming technology and how the Roku is able to buffer the streaming so the movie is shown smoothly and crisply. It does look so much better than watching NetFlix on the PC or Wii. I also have Netflix on the PS3 and Xbox360 and I find the quality comparable. Another great feature is that the audio is turned on for BOTH HDMI and left/right audio cables so you can run the sound to the receiver and TV. Unfortunately, I ran out of optical inputs on the receiver but I'm assuming that toslink connection is always on as well. I have high hopes that my mother will be able to use the Roku, and once Netflix starts providing closed-captioning on the Roku, it will be even more useful! I am just concerned about the wireless connectivity but if it does prove to be a problem, my solution would be to run ethernet straight to the Roku or wire the electrical outlets with Netgear PowerLine equipment (they seem to provide very good results)."}], "B0042A8CW2": [{"review_id": "c3022791064f122a0509d3360abdcfec", "review": "I'll be honest - I've never owned a really good pair of headphones.

I did, however, find myself frustrated with the lack of forward and back buttons. Second of all, the optical DPI was just way too low for precise aiming in FPS games. If I remember correctly someone rated it at 400dpi, which is just unacceptable. A solid trackball, but these two little errors sent me slinking back to my trusty Razer Lachesis.I actually wrote Logitech an email describing a \"gaming trackball\" with laser tracking. I highly doubt they ever read my email, but they actually released the exact product I wished for, so I jumped right on it!Unfortunately, I have yet to get an invite to the Vine program, so I actually had to dish out the 49.99 myself. I don't regret it!First of all, the wireless technology in this trackball is certainly up to date. Latency is not an issue at all, and having the option to be wireless is certainly a plus. I do wish it came with a detachable cable in case you didn't want to deal with the battery, but then again, the single AA battery this unit requires promises to last up to 18 months. If this is true then I cannot mark this product down. I've had it for two weeks now, and so far, so good. I am running Windows 7.The addition of back and forward buttons answers the plea that many people have been crying for ever since the old Microsoft Trackball Optical was discontinued: A fully featured thumb-controlled trackball that doesn't cost 400 dollars due to becoming a collectors item.To make things better, most people always agreed that the Trackman series had better ergonomics than the MS Trackball, however the lack of buttons was the big deal breaker. It seems that most companies focus on their palm/prominent fingered trackballs and totally ignore the thumb-based ones.The M570 is the answer to all these problems, well, and more.I was quite shocked and excited when I heard that it was using a laser sensor. I am unsure of the DPI since Logitech doesn't seem to release that information, but it's certainly much higher than the Trackman Wheel, which makes it a godsend. The accuracy is top notch, the glide of the ball is just right, and the buttons feel solid. Nevermind the comfort of the ball in general. There are no problems there. I really cannot find anything wrong with this ball.If I was going to add anything it would be the following: Actual published DPI rating, Additional buttons for on-the-fly DPI adjustment, and finally one of those awesome Hyperscroll wheels that Logitech has released on their gaming mice.It seems that Logitech is even downplaying the fact that this ball is laser-tracked. The question is: Why? I know I am not the only person who games with a trackball, and while many people have settled with Kensington's balls for the task, I have been waiting out for an appropriate thumb-controlled trackball. Perhaps the M570 is just a test before they release the true \"gaming grade\" trackball? Or will this be the final hurrah in the trackball world?As of writing this, the M570 is undoubtedly the best Trackball on the market, not only for gaming but also casual use. Despite the few features that could have been included, the addition of laser tracking and two control buttons make it tough to beat and fills a huge void in the market. One can only hope this device's success convinces Logitech to continue further with their trackball efforts. Until then, the M570 will be my ball of choice for headshots."}, {"review_id": "29956762dfd30915eadd8d0dc9e2df2a", "review": "I purchased this trackball January of last year (2011). Since then, it's put up with 10-12 hour per day usage. I wouldn't buy a different one, even if there was another of its type on the market.Pros:- Thumb ball design- Battery life is amazing (plus ships with a name brand battery)- Programmable buttons- Storage compartment on the mouse for the receiverCons:- Wireless (some would list this as a pro, but I really prefer a wired mouse. If your desk gets as dirty as mine, you'll understand why the first time you lose it)- Tracks get dirty quickly- Troubleshooting software requires a mouse -.-Overall, this is a great mouse, if only a little overpriced. But this is the only option, so I suppose Logitech would jack the price up a bit. If you're like me, and have been using this type of mouse since before you were potty trained, you'll want to get it. The range is about 15 feet, assuming no obstacles, and the response time is good enough for average gamers and home users. But really, if you're comparing response times, you should be going for a wired mouse (usually).Just a note on Logitech's support. I've had mixed experiences with Logitech's support, having been an original Revue owner. Recently though, I had to put in for the warranty on this device, as it was acting up and losing connection when it was used for long periods of time. Their support times were amazing, and after going through a few troubleshooting steps and giving them some personal info, they put in for a replacement. Four business days later, and I just plugged in the mouse a short while ago. That is incredible in my opinion.TL;DR: If you're used to a thumb ball, you have no other choice. Go buy it."}, {"review_id": "85768031bfa7f1fe662d709e63135f6b", "review": "HiI had 2 logitech trackballs in the past 9 or 10 years. It seemsone of the minor complaints are that the blue ball isn't as smooth as the old Red Ball.Well I still have one Red Ball from one of my old Trackballs that broke and willtest it with this new version and report back.Hey the red ball might not even work but I don't see why it shouldn't work..who knows .When I take delivery I will report back with an update .:)Edit: Well my trackball arrived today.Firs off it's much smaller than the old redball version. I wanted totest the red ball in this one but it won't fit so that's out.I'm a woman so I don't have big hands but I don't have tiny hands. That being said it fits my hand perfect. If you have big hands you might not like the fit but that shouldn't stop you if you are currently using a mouse which is smaller than the trackball.Yes the new blue ball doesn't have that slick feel that the redball had butit's still slick. You can tell the difference between the 2 if you used/owned the redball version.The blue ball is much smaller than the red ball but it doesn't hurt performance.I plugged the unifyer into the usb port and windows installed the correct driver in seconds. By the way I have Windows 7 64  and I was up and running right away..so yes no problems with windows 7 /64 for those of you that might be wondering.The 2 extra buttons on the side are programmed to go back and forward which is what I already intended to use them for anyway. Someone said the location of the 2 buttons was bad but I don't see the problem .Even if your index finger (Which is used for 1 click)wereto brush up against the side buttons nothing would happen becasue they are sturdy enough for side swipes to not activate causing you to go backward or forward.  And of course the scroll wheel which works as intended. This is without installing the software. There's no software DVD but you can get it directly from Logitechs website if you choose.One thing I don't care for much is the blueball location which is for thumb use. I like theold version where you used your index finger.It's just easier to control with the index finger than the thumb . It's not a biggie no no and there's no problem controlling the blue ball but I rather myself using the index finger.It already comes with a battery (Only needs one) and a duracell to boot.There's 4 rubber feet on the bottom which hide the screws so I'm guessing it should be easy to clean if need to when you run out of warranty.What I'm really pissed about is the price..I ordered this 2 days ago and now the price is much cheaper. I'm going to email them to see if I can get credit...hey it's like $10 with shipping..even the shipping was more 2 days ago.Big plus no freaking long wire hanging off the side of my laptop !Bottom line I'm happy again :)PS:This vendor doesn't respond to emails..a simple yes or no was required of them but I guess customer service doesn't mean anything to them.----------------------------------------------------Edit: Nov 8th 2010This vendor never did reply to my request mentioned above. Again a simple yes or no would have suffice.----------------------------------------------------Edit : Nov 11th 2012.Still working and I have dropped it many times where the battery cover and battery and ball were scattered all over and thehandset itself took a nice bang when dropped. Each time I thought it was the end but nope she'sstill chugging along.PS: Still haven't heard back from the vendor 2 years later..LOL--------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 8/10/13Still working like a champ and very surprised ,consideringhow many times I dropped this thing on my wood floor."}, {"review_id": "96c05882a0989fa2e592c04e4d394158", "review": "The M570 improves on the older Logitech Wireless Trackball in a number of ways. The USB transceiver is now a micro sized unit and is \"Unified\" so it can work with other \"Unified\" Logitech wireless devices as well. The trackball now has additional \"back/forward\" buttons although they are located in an odd location that requires you to use your index fingers. Admittedly, I am used to using my thumb for those buttons on a mouse but there's nowhere to place them with the big trackball in the way. The ball is also very tight and does not spin as freely as the original wireless trackball. It almost feels \"gritty\". The battery life is superb with a single NiMH AA, although the original trackball had excellent battery life as well. If you suffer from CTS, get a wireless trackball.

After I did that, I really feel like this thing is a part of my hand. Buttons are customizable to all sorts of configurations. I assigned music player buttons; play/pause to middle scroll and next/back two the forward and back buttons (by default these are set to work with your web browser).Pros:Take it from someone who has pain all the time in his wrists, this product pretty much rules and I am one harsh critic.Cons:Can't think of any."}, {"review_id": "19ebefea43e90a9da441b53d6e13bb39", "review": "We had the original for years, and like many came to love the trackball. One of our dogs got tangled in the mouse cord and subsequently disconnected the internal wiring. Had a computer repair shop look at it but he couldn't repair it so I went online to buy a new one. I couldn't believe the $200-$400 asking prices for the discontinued trackball. Enter Amazon.After reading reviews on this product I was concerned about driver installation, but decided to give it a shot for $40. So happy I did. Installation was quick and flawless. Simply plug in the USB receiver and the mouse was recognized fairly quickly, although it took about 4-5 minutes before the mouse would actually function. I currently use a Toshiba L675 laptop with 64 bit Vista OS. The trackball speed was far too fast out of the box for my liking, so I went to the Logitech website and downloaded the software to customize the mouse settings. That was also easy, but you will need to know your OS properties in order to choose the correct download.I have had no issues with errant scrolling or anything else. I will surely update this review in a few months after more use. If you are a fan of the original trackball, you will love this too. It is close enough in size, weight, shape, and feel, that any differences are subtle. My one small gripe is the on the old trackball, I could pop the ball out of the bottom with my finger to clean it out. This trackball has a much narrower diameter hole, and so I need a pencil or something to pop the ball out. Other than that, I'm so happy I found this product. I plan on buying two more to stick in a drawer in case the same situation ever happens with this version. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

The size is great, and the speakers are much better than I had expected for a $20 usb-powered devise. They are reasonably loud - at least twice as loud as the macbook speakers - and have decent sound quality, if only a little bass heavy. The padding on the underside makes resting the laptop on your lap a bit more comfortable, although I was hoping it to be a little softer. The pad feels like a towel that had been folded a couple times, which is nice, but I have used a similar product that had small foam pellets that more evenly distributed weight over your thighs and was a bit more comfortable over long periods.Although this product does everything it claims to do very well, in retrospect, I would rather have spent a bit more to get a product that included a fan for ventilation.

This product however definitely deserves it.The router took about 10' to install and has worked like a charm since then. Positioned in the ground floor of the house, it manages to give a strong enough signal to be received at 135 Mbps from the upper floor. And that's from my net-book, which has a quite mediocre network card. My room-mate claims that he has a super high speed, both for downloading and for uploading, from his desktop computer.The router has a fairly easy menu, though it took us a good 7 minutes to configure all the security settings (you can never be too careful these days). Other routers may be better in this aspect. However, this is something you only do once (or twice at most) so it's not a big deal.The bottom line is that this product is not just a good buy, but something you can cherish for a while. I would highly recommend it to any computer user who relies a lot on a wireless network for his/her internet access.One thing that it is a bit bizarre though is that the upload speed is about 3 times higher than the download speed, something that has been observed it two computers in our network. Usually DL speed is significantly lower than UL speed.

As far as the computers in my house go, this router seems to work just fine.  No problems connecting anywhere in the house.  My problem is with my iOS devices.  My ipad connects just fine and stays connected while in use, but loses it's connection when idle.  I use an alarm clock app at night that displays the weather.  By the time I wake up in the morning, the weather is no longer available because my connection was dropped.  I have to open my preferences and re-select my network.And that's the least of my problems.  I use my ipad as a VNC Remote, VLC Remote, and a remote file viewer for my Mac Mini.  I had never had any hiccups with my previous router, but this one will not connect with any of those three applications.  If I restart the router, I have a short period of time where they will connect before my ipad goes idle, I lose my connection, re-select my network in preferences, and then none of those three will work.  It's never just one, all three stop working at once.  I use these features of my wifi network multiple times throughout the day and this has been incredibly frustrating.I'm waiting to hear back from tech support before I box this up and send it back.  I really want to like it...it's nice looking, and fast, but I need the above features to work, or the router is near useless to me.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This was an upgrade from a Comcast leased router that, in all honesty, was perfectly fine.  We were just tired of paying for it every month.  I've only had this router for a day, but setup only took seconds.  The setup page is pretty easy to navigate and I had no problems renaming our network, creating a passcode, and forwarding the necessary ports to get my torrent clients up and running.  I don't notice any significant speed increase over a wireless G router, but very few systems are able to utilize the 150mbps this thing is capable of providing.  Anyway, the signal is strong and it's as speedy as expected.I've owned quite a few routers in my day and most of them are pretty straight forward pieces of equipment.  This one receives five stars because it does what it's supposed to and hasn't hickupped so far.  I will update my review in a few months when I have a better idea of durability and quality over time, but I don't foresee any issues.For the price, a GREAT buy, and I highly suggest getting the bundle that Amazon offers with this modem:Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem.

I finally got around to installing it yesterday.  My initial impressions were not great, to be honest.  The build quality doesn't seem great - mostly lightweight plastic, and the unit is so small and light that the two cables coming out of the back keep the unit from sitting flat on the back of my computer armoire.  I'm OK with that as long as the unit proves to last a long time with few or no reboots needed. It is too early to tell, so I will try to update this review a few months down the road.My next issue with the router came immediately after I finished the setup.  Minutes before unplugging my ZyXel router, I had a reliable network connection on my desktop computer, which has a wired connection to the router.  Upon booting up the Medialink router, I had no network connection and could not even access the router directly through my browser.  I meticulously went through the setup instructions 3 more times, being careful to unplug everything in just the right order.  Still no luck.  I then tried a wireless connection and discovered that did work.  I was able to finish the router setup wirelessly.  I then tried a wired connection from my notebook, and that also worked.  So the router itself seemed to be working fine EXCEPT that I was unable to access it from my desktop, which is a critical need.  I contacted Medialink by email but did not hear back from them quickly so called them.  The initial tech was unable to help. An hour or two later, a level 2 tech called me back and was also unable to help, suggesting that it was a hardware or software issue on my computer.  I then spent 3 hours on the phone with a Dell tech, which was a huge waste of time.  I also submitted questions on a handful of forum sites.  At 11pm, after 14 hours of trying to get this router to work, I tried plugging in the old router, and within minutes I had a working connection again.  Frustrated, I gave up on the new router and went to bed.  This morning, I spent another couple hours doing some troubleshooting before contacting Medialink again by email.  After some time with no response, I called and was told that someone would call me back.  They didn't, but they did respond to my email.  With the new info I provided, they were able to suggest that I wirelessly access the router to change the default IP address from 192.168.0.1 to what my old router had been using (192.168.10.1), then reboot the router.  That worked!  If anyone runs into a similar issue, be sure to give this a shot.  You can change the default IP address by going to Advanced Settings --> LAN Settings on the router.I'm not a hardcore geek, but I'm comfortable with technical things so I was not real happy that I had to invest so much time getting the router to work, nor was I happy about how many emails & phone calls to/from Medialink I had to invest in to get it working.  And I was slightly disappointed in how Medialink came across in their support; I just didn't feel that they were eager & willing to go the distance in helping me resolve this.  HOWEVER, to their credit, they did respond in a reasonably timely fashion, and they did eventually come through with the solution I needed (albeit because I was willing to invest the time & effort to narrow the issues down on my own, something others might not be able or willing to do).In hindsight, I would have gone with a router with a better reputation behind it that offered some additional features, better build quality, and tech support that is able to resolve issues more quickly.  However, for the price, this seems to be a decent router.  I am using 1 wired connection and several wireless devices, and the speed and reliability thus far seem great.  Others have obviously had great success with this, so as long as it continues to work well for me, I have no problems recommending it as a budget router."}, {"review_id": "2da9a9fea3df6aa16bf38dd1cedf9945", "review": "I'm sometimes a little skeptical buying something that is highly recommended on Amazon and I haven't heard of them before.

One day, I was just looking for a new Blu-ray player that had the Netflix capability and Wi-Fi and I came across the Panasonic DMP-BDT210P which also is 3D.  I don't have a 3D capable TV as yet, but I bought this one with the future in mind...baby steps.  I had no idea what to do about making the Netflix work, but research told me I needed a router.  I'd focused on Cisco routers, but this day, in reading the reviews I decided to look at other routers and I spotted this one and read some of the reviews on it and decided to try this one.  What impressed me the most was the reviewers experience with Medialink contact support. How willing their support group is to ACTUALLY HELP YOU.  I've been so sick of fighting with support personnel on other products purchased.My new blu-ray player and Medialink Wireless N Router arrived the same day.  I'm an older person.  I read the little instruction packet that came with the Medialink router, but I was still scared to try to follow the instructions. There are two little pamphlets one for IF you have a DSL modem, and one for IF you DO NOT have a DSL modem. I determined my modem is a DSL modem.  I re-read the next day.  I asked around at work about setting up a router.  I re-read the instructions AGAIN.  Then one day, I just said, I can do this!  There are 12 sections of info to follow.  My computer is NOT WIRELESS, and that was my biggest concern.  I got through the steps and was confused about WIRED VS WIRELESS.  In one part of the instruction you have the option to change your SSID, I was afraid to because I thought you would have to go through the whole thing again, so at the time I set this router up, I did not originally change the SSID, one of my co-workers told me to DEFINATELY change your passphrase from the products generic passphrase.  That part I did do.You get to the end of it, and I found something about removing the network cables which appears in the instructions on the CD that comes with it, but I don't see it in the instructions on the pamphlet insert for DSL modems. I viewed the CD only after I'd set the router up, and found that the CD has more DETAILED INSTRUCTION on installing.  Anyway, this instruction tells you that you can remove these two network cables after you have set up your router and that is where I freaked out because logic told me that if my computer is NOT WIRELESS in the first place, I cannot remove these network cables without consequences.  So, I didn't do it.  It was after Meidalink hours, when I finished my set up of this router, so I decided to leave the cables plugged and call Medialink the next day to find out what I should do.I called and explained that I was not sure if I'd installed it properly and I had a female representative, and she was very nice and very patient, and she walked me through the ENTIRE steps of setting this up and found that I'd done everything correctly and she told me that changing the SSID to whatever I wanted didn't make me have to go through any other steps and she took me to that part of the installation to change it.  She also told me that I was CORRECT that you DO NOT REMOVE THE NETWORK CABLES from the back of the router and your computer IF YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WIRELESS.  I was relived that I had not removed them.  She offered to help me set my other wireless items while she was on the phone, but I had not yet connected the Panasonic Blu-ray, and my printer required me to have the disc which I had to find.  Anyway, she told me that if I needed help installing anything I could call and receive help.I got off the phone, was able to connect the printer, and then I connected the Panasonic and it was the simplest thing I could ever have done.  All I had to do was click on Wired or Wireless during the EASY SETUP, and I chose Wireless, and it brought up two networks, one was mine, and one was someone else's, and I chose mine, and it asked for ENCRYTION KEY and I freaked out again because I didn't know what that meant.  This is the problem with technology, there are a multitude of TERMS that mean the same thing.  After several minutes, it dawned on me that they wanted me to put in my passphrase to access my network.  And I did that and it was done.I normally watch Netflix live on my computer, but now for the first time, thanks to my new Medialink Wireless N router, I watched my first Netflix from the big screen TV and I can't stop smiling about it!Another thing, I'd like to mention, I DID NOT have to move the Medialink around the room or adjust it or anything at all.  I've heard people complain about having to deal with those antenna type routers during certain conditions.  I'd wondered if I'd have go back and buy other gadgets to improve my signal, but so far, it is not necessary.I want to say to anyone who is looking to buy this item, it is a great product.  I DID NOT USE THE INSTALLATION CD to install it.  I just followed the 12 steps of information.  When you get to step 8 you are given the option to move on to step 9 or to pop in the CD.  For some reason the word (recommended) made me choose to proceed to step 9, and it all turned out perfectly.  So they are telling you the truth that you don't really need the installation CD to set this up, and I think that if your computer is WIRELESS you wouldn't keep the network cords but if your computer is like mine, and it you didn't buy it WIRELESS, you need to leave the network cords attached.Medialink - Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - NEW Design w/ Internal Antenna"}, {"review_id": "ab5d1617102b4e38bd14db097263ec0f", "review": "Like many of you, I was drawn to this router simply because it was the highest reviewed wireless-N router on Amazon for the cheapest price.  After weeks of messing around with the setup, I have never been able to keep a solid wireless connection going with this thing, and I've tested it with 3 different computers (two PC laptops running Windows 7 and one Macbook Pro, an iPad, and two iPhone 4's.  I asked to return this item but Medialink would not accept returns after 30 days.  They offered to replace the router and even the 2nd one they sent me was unstable.  I wouldn't have written a bad review if they had let me return the item, but now that I'm stuck with a $50 paperweight I felt the need to write one to warn other potential customers.After spending way too much time with trying to get the router to work, I ended up going back to my Linksys Wireless-G router.  I get higher speeds with the old Linksys with a stable connection.  Originally I wanted to go with a Wireless-N router for additional range but I'd much rather have a stable connection with slightly less range than a crappy connection with more range.After reading some of the comments on the very positive glowing reviews, I'm a little wary about the actual reviewers of this item.  Looking at some of the top reviews, their first reviewed item was this Medialink router.  To me that should have been a huge red flag, but I was blinded by the $50 price tag for a wireless-N router.  I hope you do some research and look at the top reviews and see what else they've reviewed.  A legitimate reviewer would probably have many items reviewed, and the Medialink wouldn't be the first product!Also, I should mention I was also blinded by the bright blue lights on this router.  They are WAY TOO BRIGHT!  Much brighter than the lights on anything else (i.e. cable modem, AV receiver, PS3, DVR, etc.  I had to put a piece of black electrical tape just to make it bearable.---Edit 10/13/2011:  After contacting Mediabridge as a last ditch effort I was surprised that they were so accommodating.  I told them that I already had a replacement router sent to me and I still had issues.  They were willing to grant me a full refund even though I was well outside their normal return window.  Maybe I was just extremely unlucky and got 2 defective routers but I don't want to spend anymore time trying to get this product to work for me.  I am revising my review from 1 star to 2 stars based on their customer service.  I wish more companies would stand by their products like Mediabridge does."}, {"review_id": "1d871ee0af1a45d08379c3420556d06b", "review": "Other than some confusion when configuring the various settings, this wireless/broadband router has been great.

It does not promise to be a whole-house security system with real time recording, etc. If you want that, look elsewhere and expect to pay more.But what you do get is a very good camera with high quality imaging that can be set up quickly and accessed by an easy to use app.I installed this camera in a matter of minutes on my home system (Mac based). The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite \"real time\" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera.

I use Airplay to send audio to an Airport Express, from which I use line-out to connect to a stereo. Previously I had a compact shelf stereo system, but the sound was very muddy and lacked articulation. Weak amp, high distortion.The Lepai Amplifier is a huge improvement over what I had before. I want to set it and forget it -- set the volume and shove it under a dresser -- and this unit is perfect for that. Low idle current is important, and this unit seems to stay very cool. (I'll measure the idle wattage later.)When I first plugged it in, there seemed to be a lot of strange digital-sounding distortion, especially on higher pitches. I took the amplifier apart to see what their circuit layout and component choices were, and then reassembled and reinstalled it. Now it sounds fine. I'm not sure if I jiggled something, or it just needed to break in, or if there was a grounding issue or what.Some downsides to the product are the cheap enclosure (but at least it's metal, not plastic.) Mine came with small threads of glue all over the underside. The knobs are smooth, but plastic feeling. Mine came with a power supply, but it says \"Vonage\" on it. They probably got a good deal on someone else's old stock. The datasheet for the Tripath amplifier chip in this unit suggests a supply voltage of 13.5V, but the included power supply is 12V 2A. Sometime later I'll hook up a DC bench power supply and see if I can hear a difference.The biggest downside is the insanely bright blue LED that illuminates when the unit is powered on. I have the thing shoved under a dresser, and it lights up the whole floor. I'm going to replace it with a dim red one (soldering required.)For the price, however, this can't be beat.

My old D-Link DIR-615 was fast enough but I was never really happy with the wireless coverage. We have a 2 story home and as long as you were on the same floor, you were OK, but the other floor was spotty at best.The other problem I had with the old router was the limited number of concurrent connections it supported. As the number of wireless devices increased in the house (smart phones, iPods, several laptops, an E-reader, the Wii... you get the picture) I started getting complaints about dropped connections and/or the router being frozen.After researching what was available and working well for others, I settled on the Asus RT-N56U. The Asus has all the features I need such as high concurrent connection limits and extended range in the 2.4 GHz band (the band I use with my work laptop).So far, I couldn't be happier. The unit was easy to setup and plugged into my home network (wired and wireless) with zero issues. My work laptop now gets 5 bar - excellent coverage on both floors of my home and we have no issues with dropped connections or router hangs.We have connected the following wireless devices to the Asus with no issues:- iPhone 4s- Motorola Atrix- Blackberry Bold- iPod touch- Epson Workforce635- MacBook Pro (uses the 5 Ghz band)- Dell laptops (Win xp and Win 7)- Nook color- Wii- Samsung Blu-ray- Asus TF300 Tablet- Nokia Lumina 900- iPhone 5- iPad miniThe unit came with an older firmware, but it was painless to upgrade to the latest. I simply downloaded the latest firmware from Asus to a PC and then upgraded the router via the admin web interface.My only complaint is the bandwidth graphs don't show traffic by device. Instead, you can see the traffic by total, wired, 2.4 GHz wireless and 5 GHz wireless.One final note. I use the Cisco VPN client on my laptop to connect to the office  and it has worked flawlessly since day 1. No changes required to the client, work or the router.Update 6/11/12Just a quick update to add a couple of new devices that work flawlessly with the Asus router.

It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).

One was the main router and the other was an access point connected to the first via Ethernet cable. In the past few months, one of them started acting up and I decided this was a good time to upgrade. After reading lots of reviews, this was the router I chose and I bought two of them.The entire experience couldn't have gone smoother. After turning off my old routers, I opened one of these and set it up to be the main router. The order of turning things on in the manual didn't work out for me, so I just unplugged everything and started them in order from the cable: cable modem, router, then computer. Doing that, everything talked fine. I ran the quick setup, then went back to change the settings to the choices I wanted. I upgraded the firmware, set an SSID for each band, turned on WPA-Personal and set keys, played with a few other settings (setting IP and hard-coded DNS servers) and restarted everything again with all of my wired Ethernet devices plugged in. I left choices that I used to make manually, like channels, to auto. It worked perfectly right off the bat.Then I set up the second router as an access point. This router has a particularly nice feature in that you can just tell it that you want it to be an access point, rather than a full router, and it makes all the changes to the settings for you. If that's not enough, when in the access point mode, the WAN port becomes a LAN port so you don't have to waste one of your four wired ports on connecting the two routers together. Very nice! I turned off all the various server functions, gave it an IP, set it up with the same SSIDs and keys, took it upstairs, plugged in the wired peripherals and turned it on. Like the first one, it just worked.It's just been one day, so I can't speak to things like longevity, but the set up was easy and the routers seem really solid. As expected, the 2.4GHz band gives me greater range, but that range is greater than what I used to get with my old Linksys. The 5.0GHz band has about the same range as my old Linksys... perhaps a tad smaller. As it turns out, while I did have some speed problems on the old setup, both bands here give me fast, reliable connections, so I really don't see much effective difference between connecting to the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands in practice. Since I run my streaming video via wired Ethernet, I guess that makes sense. I probably didn't need a dual-band router, in hindsight, but I'm happy with this.Also, the combination of this change, and a new cable modem, have resulted in about a 20% increase in my Internet speed. I can't say which component(s) are responsible, but I'm happy with the result. In the end, I can't imagine anyone asking for more in terms of ease of setup or short-term performance than this router. I recommend it.**UPDATE**January 2 2012I bought these back in August and by mid-December, I started having problems with connectivity to the Internet. Some things would work (like web browsing) and others wouldn't (like checking email). If I left it alone, eventually, it wouldn't pass along any traffic at all. Whenever it happened, a quick unplug and re-plug would solve the problem. I won't go into all the details of the troubleshooting, but it turns out that both units I bought have gone bad. I have shipped one back to ASUS for replacement and am limping along with just the one (and having to restart it all the time). When that one is replaced, then I'll send the second one back. I really like the features on these routers, but I can no longer recommend them. When two out of two have failed, then it's hard to think that it's just one of those things. I have lowered by rating from 5-stars to 3.January 23 2012The stars just keep falling on this for me. I still haven't received the one back that I sent for replacement/repair even though their web site status says it was repaired weeks ago. (They received it Jan 5.) They just won't bother shipping it back to me. In the meantime, the other one finally became unusable, so my investment in two of these relatively expensive routers has ended up for nothing. I just ordered an RMA number for the second one. Since it's not working, I may as well see if they'll actually fix it and return it. We'll see. To ASUS's credit, their tech support people are friendly and helpful and one guy did offer today to see if he can get the repair people to ship mine out. I can't live without Internet access, so I ended up buying a factory refurbished Linksys E2500 for about one-third of the price of these. It's running brilliantly and now I'm not even sure I want these ASUS routers back in service once they're fixed. I'm seriously considering buying a second Linksys and selling these when they come back. I've reduced my rating to 2-stars. What's the point of buying high-end products if they keep failing?February 16, 2012The first router is finally on its way back to me. They promise 10 day service, but by the time I get it back, it will have been 42 days. In the meantime, I bought a second refurbished Linksys E2500, and I am not putting the ASUS ones back in service when they do get back. The Linksys routers work much better, have stronger signals and (most importantly) are working reliably. My Netflix used to pause and stop to re-buffer all the time. I never knew if that was about the routers, the cable modem or the Internet service itself, but that hasn't happened once since putting the new routers in place. Yeah, the last star is falling away. I'm getting better service from routers that cost one-third of what these do, so I'll be selling these when they get back.December 3, 2012I've been using the Linksys routers as described above and had left my two Asus routers, returned from repair, in their boxes. I had intended to sell them, but never got around to it. Recently, I decided to set up a media server and thought that gigabit wired Ethernet would be a good idea (the E2500s are 10/100 routers). Cable Internet doesn't come into the house fast enough for that to matter, but moving HD video around the house might. I figured, since I have these two repaired Asus routers sitting here, I'd go ahead and swap out the Linksys ones for them. The Asus ones do have a lot more features. So I upgraded to the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.260), set them up from scratch and put them to work. The good news is that the new firmware does support IPv6 and it works fine. The bad news is, they only lasted two days before acting up again. After working Saturday night and Sunday, I sat down with my iPad tonight and, despite a 4-bar signal, it wouldn't open a web page reliably. I switched it from the 2.4 GHz to the 5 GHz network, and it worked again for a while, then stopped working again. Then I tried to play a show on Netflix from my Apple TV (wired, not wireless) and for the first time since my last update, the show kept stopping to reload the buffer. I swapped the two Linksys routers back into the network and all problems cleared up instantly. Apparently these work for some people, but even after repair and an update to the latest firmware, I am having no luck. Now I'm reluctant to sell them, since they don't really work, so I guess I'll finally write off this loss and give up on Asus altogether."}], "B004E10KFG": [{"review_id": "e9bfd2a5b28a37c2799acd577f6a7852", "review": "There are many times when I just want my background music to follow me to the patio, on the road, in the kitchen, at meetings -- even at the beach. We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX."}, {"review_id": "e4a5066cae8aaa4192666a57e5ff388c", "review": "I never imagined I would spend $200 on a tiny wireless speaker system but the rave review by David Pogue in the New York Times swayed me to splurge.It was delivered in about 36 hours to my door. BUT after spending frustrating hours trying to get it to work - software downloads from the Jawbone website and phone support from their eager staff - it was decided that the unit was defective and should be returned. Unhappy, I persuaded them to ship the replacement unit overnight. Jawbone will not pay for return shipping of a defective unit or provide a shipping label, believe it or not for such a pricey purchase, so I add another $10 to the $200 I already paid. So I only rate the Jambox as four stars because they have a quality control problem and a mean-spirited return policy for their stupid defective units.Now, happily with minimal effort as I already had the required software loaded, the tiny unit can play music streamed via Bluetooth from both my iPhone and iPad anywhere in my apartment without the unit being anywhere near them. As David Pogue said - \"Magic!\" AND it also acts as a cell phone answerer and speakerphone with built-in microphone. When the unit is on it will automatically silence the speakers on my iPhone or iPad and hold this stream if a phone call comes in at the same time. The sound quality is much better than I expected from a palm-sized 12oz gadget. I can walk around the house taking it from room to room as I do other things and listen at the same time to my music. I can watch videos and streaming movies on my iPhone or iPad with great big sound instead of tinny little sound from the mini-speakers in the devices. Somehow this big sound makes the videos seem much more compelling to watch. I can hear no buzzing, hissing or other wireless interference so the sound is completely clean to listen to classical music.Pressing a button on top of the unit brings a voice that tells you how much battery life is left. It is claimed to play for 10 hours before needing re-charge but I haven't yet tested this.I can imagine taking this with me on car journeys to listen to music on my iPhone and answer phone calls on the road with just the press of one button and no driving distraction. I also plan to take it with me on vacations to play in hotel or cruise ship rooms. The price is too high but what-the-hell for such convenience."}, {"review_id": "9e43856b38c641a41b88bbdc494e6df7", "review": "My wife lost her first one, which was her constant travel companion for business trips. HAD to get her another one! Red is cool, and the sound is quite amazing. Best boom box for an iPhone bar none."}, {"review_id": "929b54ba73bbcc01886f35853d193ffc", "review": "I bought this device for $150 instead of 200 during a (Black Friday?) sale. This is a pretty crucial difference.I'm going to basically jump into pros and cons, then conclude. I will compare to theMonster ClarityHD Precision Micro Bluetooth Speaker 100 Portable Bluetooth Speaker (MBL CLY SPKR BT)at some points.Pros:-Great design, looks fantastic (I like all the colors except red, but I really liked the \"grill\" on the grey one).-Very minimalistic, simple, and elegant. Follows an \"Apple\" product theme. It has only 3 buttons, and the on/off switch.-Sound Quality is good. This is a small speaker so its never going to be amazing, but I find it rather good for the size. This speaker shines in having good High/Lows, a very rich sound, and really good Bass. In comparison to the Clarity HD which I also tried, the sound is much richer. Though the Clarity HD does indeed have good clarity, the Jambox is as good in that sense as well.-Very easy to use, pairing is incredible fast and simple (after I got it out of the box it was paired in maybe 15 seconds).-Has a website where you can download some small features (kind of useless) but also new firmware and technology that is improving the sound of the Jambox such as \"Live Audio\". Live Audio (i think) separates the Left and Right more and I do indeed think it improves the sound, but it comes at the cost of having a lower Maximum volume. More on volume below.-10 hour battery life. I never actually checked this and I seriously doubt it's 10 hours, but it's much higher advertised than the other bluetooth speakers, so it's safe to assume that the batterlife even if not 10 hours, is still much longer than other speakers like the Clarity HD.Cons:-Loudness. I think the loudness of this speaker is mis-advertised as I was a little bit dissapointed. At home, this thing is great. Easily fills my room, and when I turned it up downstairs, you could still hear it Upstairs in different rooms. If you want the better sound with Live Audio, it is ~2-3 volume levels (Clicks of the button) less, so it is quite a bit. When I took this to a social function with about 15 people all in a room, you could hardly hear some songs when people were talking. This also however depends on the song itself. I think if you were to turn up most songs in Itunes (Volume wise) above 100%, they would still sound good (not distorted). So I hope that the volume cap is put higher in a update (which is why updates are a very nice feature). The Clarity HD gets much louder, but once again the sound is a lot worse. If volume is crucial for you, the Clarity HD might be a nice option (Check out my review on it). Overall I think most people are going to be satisfied with the volume, and if you really need a boost, you can connect the device by wire and the sound gets MUCH louder, as loud if not louder than the Clarity HD on bluetooth.Edit: Along with LiveAudio, there is also a feature called \"Sound Clarity\" which once again, says it will improve audio sound at the cost of some volume, when LiveAudio is DISabled. So I had both these features enabled therefore I didn't have maximum sound. So this device CAN get a little bit louder than I thought. I still think the choice between volume and sound quality is a nice one, however to change this you need to connect to a computer, so this cannot be easily shifted on the go.-Price, $200 is a lot but the market for these devices is quite high as it is. The Clarity HD is twice as cheap on Amazon right now, but as i said before, I got my Jambox for $150 so that made a huge difference in my mind. For $50 more, I would hands down prefer the Jambox over Clarity HD. For $100, the question becomes more clouded. If you have the money and are willing to spend it, you will not feel bad about spending $150 as I think you will be very satisfied with the Jambox, it's just got a pleasing feel to it.(This isn't really a con, but a concern) -Portability: Im not certain how portable this is. Its really small and easy to carry but you do need some kind of bag, as its awkward to just carry in your hand. You do get a nice case with it. The best option without an extra bag is I guess a decently big jacket pocket would fit it. It is portable but I think its kind of peculiar to carry around, if you have Purse or some kind of backpack or anything, that problem is dissolved.Conclusion: This is a great product though it is quite pricey. It has really good sound quality and bass for its size and purpose. I am concerned about how loud this could get in a very loud enviornment, but I suspect for most people, it will be good enough. The firmware updates make this kind of problem solvable, and leave the Jambox with room to improve. The design and features are really nice. Compared to the Clarity HD, I think the reviews are misleading. The Clarity HD has notable MUCH worse sound quality, but it does get louder and is cheaper. The firmware updates are a nice touch and give you options for better sound, which is also very nice. In every other aspect such as design and battery life, the Jambox is also supreme.Extra-Topical: My Jambox is actually going to be RMA'd beacuse it has some kind of glitch or is defective, but a few times, the Bluetooth connection would just be a random sound, like a signal, but it wouldnt play any music and would make weird crackling sounds. The wire would still play music however. Recently I could barely even get bluetooth to play music, rather than these weird sounds as if it were broken, so this is a big problem. I am hoping this is just my unit so its not impacting the review, but if my new one has this problem, I may make an edit.Also, this isnt really a connectivity drop because it isnt silence, its this weird droning noise. But on the topic of connectivity. Ive never had a drop on my Itouch even while walking downstairs which the Jambox is upstairs. However, my sisters IPhone 4G had like 4 drops in one session of listening. Im not really sure what caused the connection loss and I dont know if its specific to the Iphone 4G but this may be a problem. Never happend to me though."}], "B004G6002M": [{"review_id": "62a442ccf22300b90d4af9f515c98484", "review": "I will be getting a 64gb or bigger soon. You can never have too much space on your phone.

The ability to use an external mic for stereo video sound is another great feature. The available settings & options seem nearly limitless to me at this point.

This camera is amazing.  This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.

I wish that you could have more frame rate options in 720p and I also wish that ISOs above 400 were a little less noisy.The kit lens is nice, but I recommend that you get a larger telephoto lens.  The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.

Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision. I really, really like this new camera--and I take it everywhere!"}, {"review_id": "fe6db2b607fbb4301435b3ef57f74eb3", "review": "I love  this  camera and Canon products in general, however  it has some issues. The issues did not happen straight away. On the second day of shooting  is when the trouble started.  I make no claim to be a professional photographer, this review is an opinion of a photo hobbyist. So after shooting around a 180 pictures mostly with the view finder the camera went dead no power to the unit. I also had an error code display, I can't  say  for sure  that I could see the entire code, but the camera stopped working. When this happened I removed the battery, and placed it back in the camera, and then the camera powered on. It  performed flawlessly for about 20 or more shots. The shots I took looked amazing but I also had some bad shots. I will take credit for the bad shots  it was not the fault of the camera. When I was finished shooting,  I removed the camera battery and placed it in the charger. The very next day I went for a photo shoot. I shoot mostly view finder,I shot about 200 photos this time. When I was finished shooting  I turned the camera off. Sometime later I went to use the camera  again, I turned the camera on, and no responded. I removed the battery, and charged it, when it was fully charged I placed the battery in the camera and  it worked just fine. I have not used the camera since. I'm concerned with the camera , I bought the camera to use on a family vacation. I don't want to have my camera fail on my vacation, so the following morning I called Amazon Customer Service. I explain my situation with the camera. Amazon is sending me a new camera, expedited shipping it will be here on Wednesday. I will rate this camera with 4 stars.  I will subtract one star for being  unreliable, I really love this camera , and hope the next one will be problem free. I could have just received a lemon I understand  that. Would I recommend this camera to someone else despite its shortcomings.  The answer is yes, however  my tune my change if  I receive another unit with the same issues. Well if that happens I will cut my loses and get a refund sad to say. I owned many Canon cameras both film, and digital and all of those examples performed flawlessly. Until then I will wait with anticipation  for the  new unit to arrive. I rate 5 stars to Amazons customer service they always shine in my eyes. More to follow and, hopefully the next review will be great.Sincerely Robert"}], "B004J3ZV62": [{"review_id": "3e4501e2e17acb27f6c2f5194a47d331", "review": "I bought this Canon Powershot Elph 300 HS camera because i needed to replace  my Canon powershot sd1400IS .

I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the \"smart auto\" not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the \"P\" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.  The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable."}, {"review_id": "6bb634aede39f9f28614a649f4a26f77", "review": "The Canon 300HS an excellent camera as long as you accept that it's not a \"baby S95.\" If you want fast access to manual controls, this is not the camera for you. If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in \"Auto\" mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded \"water color painting\" effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition. I would recommend it to anyone looking to produce good-looking photos with minimal fuss."}], "B004J4VYG2": [{"review_id": "cfd1d82c1289e79b07ed1da1d325e987", "review": "I used this for months before even thinking about writing a review, mostly because I didn't have all that much occasion to \"authentically\" use it. I can't, unfortunately, compare this to other brands of portable GPS, as my only other GPS experience has been with Honda's built-in system. If you have to have GPS, don't have a smart phone, and are unlikely to need this on-the-fly, I could recommend it. But not without reservation.The biggest problem I've had with it is that it takes FOREVER for the unit to acquire a signal when first turned on. It seems like the longer it's been off, the longer it takes to get a satellite signal, but I wouldn't swear to that. Sometimes, though, it takes ten or fifteen minutes, and if I'm actually trying to go somewhere, I very rarely have that long to wait.Once it does get the satellite, it works fairly well, though it's not super-intuitive. The touch screen isn't greatly accurate, but it works well enough. You definitely can't use it while you're driving, but, I mean, I guess you're not supposed to do that anyway.The maps are good and accurate, but the route is never the one I'd choose. This is true of all auto-mapping software, though, and just a problem with the genre.The screen is bright and easy to see, and the contrast changes automatically for day or night, which is nice. I can't figure out how to shut up the woman who gives the directions for more than a few minutes a time, which is the number one reason I've pretty much completely stopped using it.Again, most of these issues are with the genre itself, and this unit does perform well (other than the satellite thing), and seems reasonably priced for what you get.

The photos are full of colourful specks of noise and are very smudgy and blurry, even at ISOs as low as 400!  At 800, 1600 they are a disaster!  The exposure of videos is poor and overall, low light performance is also very poor.  I took a photo of my livingroom under tungster/halogen lighting which came out OK but again with much noise.  Then I made a video of the same room right afterwards under the same lighting conditions and the video was too dark.  This camera also has no exposure compensation for videos.  I read the manual and it clearly indicates that videos are strictly in automatic mode with no exposure control at all by the photographer.  You are at the mercy of the camera.  The Canon PowerShot SX220/230 HS DOES have exposure compensation for videos FYI...The only good thing is that the videos are smooth because of a fast 60fps (interlaced i - not progressive p though).  And having a GPS is just a gimmick and a toy to fool consumers, and does not make the picture quality of this camera any more \"attractive\" or in any way better.Having a Leica lens is not enough because a good digital camera also needs a good image sensor.  The actual sharpness and noise level in the image is determined largely by the sensor.  One can have the best lens in the world and have a poor sensor and the resulting photos and videos will be horrible.  This camera is not worth it!

Living in Texas means a base temperature indoors of about 80F for much of the year and I've had some bad issues with overheating and crashing on my previous rig when playing games.Installation on an Intel based mainboard was painless (AMD looks slightly more intimidating from the manual). In fact, it was not harder than installing a stock cooler and absolutely nothing when compared with the complexity of traditional waterbased cooling systems. It comes with pre-applied thermal paste that does the job just fine, although I suspect you could get even better cooling results with high end thermal paste. The H100 installs very conveniently in the case and does not clutter up the interior at all, which I consider a definite plus.The cooling performance of the product is excellent, and better than what Corsair advertises on the box. The difference to the stock cooler that came with my processor is dramatic, double digit degrees on all settings. The H100 has three speed settings for the fans controlled via a button located on top of the part attached to the CPU. Unless you have an easily accessible case, you will likely not be changing fan speeds very much. There's apparently an additional hardware product that can be used to control the fans from an optional front panel, but I have not found it necessary to change speed away from the minimum setting unless I seriously overlock my CPU.The noise profile of the device is great, but certainly not silent, as long as it is not set to it's maximum speed setting.Some words of caution: This cooler requires some serious space and there are not many cases on the market that will work with it outside the box. On my Level 10-GT gaming case installing it meant removing one of the 210mm fans that came preinstalled to allow installation of this one. Do yourself a favor and do some research if your case has space for the H100 (The grill slightly larger than the 2 fans attached to it).Bottom line: Excellent cooler, comparatively easy installation, decent noise profile.

It took us a while to get the thing set up, entering account info and registering for the various services but connecting to my wireless network was relatively simple and the TV downloaded an important update right after initial connection was made. Pairing the remote required that I hold the remote pretty close to the hot spot on the lower right corner of the TV but once paired, it worked flawlessly. My Time Warner cable remote however, still is not properly synched and connected to my new Samsung components so I may need to call Time Warner on this; the synch codes I used and the auto synch process did not fully work.Netflix is not what it used to be; the service seems to have only older movies and not the 'just released' films. This, along with nearly intolerable rebuffering pauses and an annoying black flash blip which happens every 3 mins or so makes me wonder if Netflix is really worth the subscription fee anymore. I ordered a new Apple Airport Extreme to upgrade to the new dual band technology so I am hoping that this fixes this rebuffering and drop out problems otherwise it is not likely that I will go past the free trial of Netflix. Blu-rays and DVDs look fantastic on this TV played on my new Samsung BD-D5500. The TV automatically connects to the Blu-Ray and switches ports when you turn it on. Cool.You need to play with the settings on the TV before you know what you like in terms of picture and sound. I was very impressed with the built-in sound of this TV, clearly upgraded over previous models, but I picked up an audio Y-cable and connected the TV directly to my stereo receiver's tape deck 'in' port and now when I activate the receiver's 'Tape' button, I get crystal clear stereo sound to go with my amazing picture. Even though this system supports surround sound 5.1 I am not missing it. The 3D features of this TV are mind-blowing but it does give you a headache after a while; you can sense the flicker of the battery powered glasses. Not all 3D discs are equal, some are a let-down and despite the hype, you likely won't end up watching 3D programming very often. The 3D starter kit comes with 2 pair of glasses and there's a coupon to get two more pair for free by mail so at least it's not too expensive for everyone to get the taste of 3D when they want it. The 2D picture though is beyond incredible. The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin and relatively lightweight. Stand is heavy and stable; ports are clearly marked but there is very little room to plug in the HDMI cables at back, especially since the pro cable I got for the Blu-Ray has a magnetic shield barrel on the cable and this presses against the back of the TV and seems to slightly bend the port so it is better to use HDMI cables that lay flat.The Samsung apps work pretty well but they are clearly still young and need development. I spent nearly two years researching TVs and am very happy I got this Smart-TV model. Dynamic LED backlighting was a key feature for me, there is absolutely no flashlighting or ghosting, blacks are deep and solid.

I have to be very careful not to accidentally hit the power button when putting it inside (certainly the slate will turn off in a few minutes, but it will be hotter than heck by the time it does) and it take a bit more force to coax the slate out when I want it.I do not believe it is water-proof, however, I have run from the car in the rain with it, and it did not soak through. I was in the rain for about 10 seconds and it was not a deluge, so I would not assume that your contents would survive unscathed from something more than a few splashes of water, but usually that is all should be allowed to hit anything holding electronics anyhow.If the opening stretches with time, I will update this review (and probably raise the stars), but for now it offers good protection for my slate PC."}, {"review_id": "ff00234e818c460ef8bd09506084966d", "review": "Fits like a glove, its soft and has a great pocket for your ethernet adapter.

The TV is incredibly thin, if you get a ultra-thin wall mount (got mine from Monoprice) the distance of the front panel to wall is about 3 inches. Since the remote has a QWERTY keyboard I thought it was going to be very large, however the form factor and size of the remote is very decent. The 240hz motion is a requirement, my friend has a 120hz recently purchased TV and I could immediately tell the difference.PROS: thin profile, smart applications, DLNA, QWERTY remote, 240hz motionCONS: QWERTY remote usability is not integrated into all applications (example QWERTY doesn't work with Youtube app). Thin profile (yes this is a negative as well): all manufacturers that make thin profile TVs should consider separate component units so that you only have to run 1 wire (power + data) to the TV. The thin profile of the TV makes it very difficult to access and modify cables once its wall mounted. The USB ports are definitely inaccessible once the TV is mounted (recommending plugging in a USB extender cable ahead of time)**I got an ultra-thin wall mount and since there's barely 1inch clearance behind the TV you HAVE to dismount the TV in order to modify cable connections, unless you have a retractable wall mount I don't think its possible to make any cable modifications without dismounting the TV. Also I got 24AWG HDMI cables, which are awesome cables but make it more difficult to use with a thin profile TV and ultra-thin wall mount."}], "B004OOTRPC": [{"review_id": "579ad75f8b89ba96df449a94b5afc224", "review": "The GoodI ordered the 55\" model from Amazon. It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected. As always, you can't go wrong by shopping at Amazon. When I first unpacked LG Infinia LW5600, I was so pleased at the aesthetics. I hadn't actually seen one in person and was amazed at how sleek looking the front was, and how incredibly thin this television is. It's amazingly about 1\" thick. It has a nice swivel base, which I love. At this point I wasn't going to mount it on the wall, but given it's incredibly thin profile, I would some day; it would look awesome on a wall. It was easy to mount on the base, and the television is light enough, a strong enough person could do it without help. I didn't have any problem. I turned it on went through the easy to follow initial setup. Easy Easy Easy to set up, and connect to a home network via WIFI.This set has more bells and whistles than you'll ever need, some being really cool. It has the standard stuff like Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and even Facebook. It also has a web browser that allows you to brows the web just like you would on your computer. Pretty cool on a 55\" HD screen. The web browser even has some nice tools such as Favorites. There are Apps, just like you would find on a smart phone; some free and some for purchase. The \"magic wand\" remote is pretty cool, with it's Wii like function of just point at the TV, move the cursor over an item, and click. In other words, when you hear the term \"feature rich\" this TV certainly is.The passive 3D is pretty cool, although I don't have a 3D blue ray movie in my collection yet. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly pretty cool and pretty well done. With the conversion feature, you won't get things popping out of the screen, but it does add depth to the picture, sort of like watching real life through a 55\" window. The glasses are very comfortable, to the point I forgot I had them on. You can walk around the house with them on and they do not hinder your vision. However, I did notice, with the passive 3D, you can't get to far off center from the picture because you'll get a lot of crosstalk. I did view some true 3D content in the apps section, which did have things popping right out of the screen. I was impressed with the 3D.The BadFirst let me say, I'm crushed this TV didn't live up to what is could be. I wanted to keep it so badly, mostly because if it's awesome features, and the sleek look. Then I started actually watching television. It was all uphill from there. Let's just point out the very poor sound quality form the speakers. I expected that. You can't expect theatre sound from a TV that's an inch thick, or any other flat screen TV for that matter. I also noticed, very distinctly, what some are calling the \"Soap Opera Effect\". It makes the picture, no matter what the source, BluRay, Cable, Netflix, etc... look like it was filmed on a home video camera. It's very odd and hard to explain, but it's like watching a low budget public access show that can't afford the really expensive professional video cameras and lighting they use to make Hollywood movies. Grab your video camera, go out in your back yard, and film your family, then watch it on your TV. That's what all programming looks like on the TV; even Avatar looked like it was filmed informally with a cheap camera, even though in HD. To be honest, at times, it was pretty interesting to see things in that perspective, but mostly it gets annoying because you never see anything as it was intended by the director. In other words, it's a huge drawback, but not the biggest.The biggest drawback is the different aspects of the horrible picture quality. First, let me explain, this ain't my first rodeo. I've owned plasma and LCD TVs, ranging from 40\" to 50\". So setting up a good picture is something I'm quite familiar with. I spent three days tweaking the settings in this TV, trying to get the colors, brightness, etc... where I like it. It seemed to get one thing right, I had to sacrifice another. Finally I just settled by saying it's not the best, but I could probably live with it, although it still ticked me off. Of the poor picture quality issues, this wasn't the worst. The worst and complete deal breaker was the incredible amount of motion blur and shuttering you get from this set. It's horribly intolerable, even to the point of causing horrible eye strain. This is in regular 2D mode, mind you. The \"True Motion\" feature is useless. In fact even LG Support suggests you turn it off. After the first couple of days of trying to get rid of the juddering effect, I called LG customer support and got a tech on the line. He said I'd have to switch the AV mode to GAME mode. This helped some, but only some. The motion blur and juddering were still intolerable, and what you gained by using GAME mode, you lost by adding a ghosting effect around any moving objects on the screen. The LG tech said, and I quote, \"if that didn't fix it, that's just how the picture is then.\" Anyway, what's the point of having different \"Modes\" if you can only use GAME Mode? Didn't matter anyway, it still didn't solve the problem.In the end, the TV is sitting in my guest bedroom now, all packed up, and waiting for the shipping company to pick it back up to return it to Amazon. I went to Walmart yesterday and purchased a 60\" Panasonic 2D Plasma they have on sale for $898 This set was awesome right out of the box as soon as I turned it on. I spent less than 10 minutes tweaking the picture settings and I'm done. It's awesome every time now. I really wanted to love the LG set, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that you purchase a television to enjoy watching it, and this set did nothing but frustrate and annoy me. I wouldn't recommend it. You still can't beat a plasma TV for picture quality."}, {"review_id": "272bfc2394a90b64197684f50b1f021c", "review": "I could hardly wait to offer my review of this television.I was a bit worried about the purchase for a few reasons:Since it wasn't the 240 hz refresh rate, I worried that the picture wouldn't be as clear and sharp as my Samsung 47\" with the 120 hz rate. I, so far, have been proven wrong about that. The picture is excellent any way you look at it.Now, I'm not a big gamer. I'm too old for that (although I do own both an Xbox with Kinect and a Wii). So I can't verify the issues other reviewers stated about the slower refresh rate causing their video to lag while playing. As of yet, I saw no lag in anything I viewed to date. I truly believe that unless you are going to be one of those ultimately picky people that I have come across in other reviews, whether you choose to purchase this TV with the 120 hz rate of the 240, I feel you will enjoy the picture either way.One comparison I have between my Samsung 47\" and the LG 55\" is that it seems with all the reviews of these TV's, people are complaining about the light LED bleeding especially from the corners. I saw that very sugnificantly with the Samsung. But, I have to say with my experience of owning this TV in the last week, there is no such bleeding to speak of. The upper left corner seems to display a slightly lighter glow than the other three but nothing to really be annoyed about. After watching the movie \"Cowboys + Aliens\" last night, I was awe struck by the clarity of the picture and the true to life colors. No, it wasn't a blu ray copy, just the standard DVD copy and it was still awesome. I felt as if I could walk right into the screen and be part of the movie. With my theatre sound and that picture, I felt as if I was back at the theatre watching it for a second time. Oh, and it was also not in 3D mode either.I am not sure I am all that big on the local dimming option either because I was a little annoyed that when the scene went dark, and I had the room dark with just the christmas tree lights on, the picture would darken. Then when some sort of lighting would appear on screen, the picture would lighten back up to normal. I thought this was odd as to me, shouldn't the picture, in a brighter setting then become dim instead of brighter? I don't know maybe I was seeing it incorrectly, not sure.As other reviewers have commented about the 3D for this television, in a way I do find it kind of gimmicky, (if that is a word). But, that too, is still a very awesome feature for home theatre. By gimmicky, I found that while using the 3D mode during regular television viewing, if the frame of actors was still with not much movement, then the picture appeared 2D. But once the scene got more active and there was more background motion, then one can very much so see the depth of 3D. I also noticed that when viewing a program in true HD, if in 3D mode, the sharper the picture, the more the 3D depth stands out. Now, movies and videos that are shot in 3D are awesome! I have TRON Legacy in 3D. With the purchase of this TV I also purchased an LG 3D blu ray player. It was so awesome being able to view that movie feeling as if I was at the theatre watching it for the second time in 3D. It is so cool also, with the passive 3D, one can view movies and shows in 3D without worrying about a second box or if the batteries are going to die. You just put the glasses on when switched to 3D mode and totally enjoy!The LG apps are ok. There could be more. One reviewer totally put down the Netflix app. I found nothing wrong with it. It loaded my shows just fine and I actually watched and episode of \"The Munsters\" in 3D. Very cool. I dowloaded the 3D Zone app. It's a cool app if you want something to give you the feel of what your 3D watching experience should be like. The videos are streamed over the internet connection and since my wireless seems a bit hoaky at times where it is located, I had to wait for each 30 second set of video to keep downloading. I also didn't like the way the producers of these 3D vidoes felt it necessary to combine the logos for the videos with actual moving background videos. The whole experience was very annoying for me to watch with all that misplaced movement going on. Once you get passed the logos and the actual video begins to play, then it's pretty cool to watch in 3D.My whole experience with the product at this point is in one word \"Awesome\"! Unless some failure happens with it or I notice other anomolies, I would definitely recommend this product to others. It's a very fun and enjoyable home theatre experience. Reviewers are mentioning how the TV cuts the resolution in half for each eye so you still get the 1080P HD picture. Well all that is way too techincal for this reviewer to worry about. All I know, from my experience the last few days, this product, whether in 3D or not, gives a very sharp, clear, wathable picture. It has a whole suite of picture setting options, some even I don't understand what they do.Oh, and I also find the magic remote quite useful. I prefer using it with the pointer on the screen as a \"one click and point\" button solution over trying to go through the menu options and trying to find all the right keys on the regular remote, especially if you can't see them in the dark. It's so much easier to use than the standard remote control. So, for me, the magic remote is a huge plus!The only drawback I found annoying, as others have mentioned, the speakers for these thin tv's have a bit to be desired. But what can one expect. I felt that once you adjust all the sound options, you can get some pretty good sound out of the built in speakers so again that function isn't even too bad. But, I want to be able to add my first sub-woofer for added bass during regular TV viewing, without having to run it through the stereo reciever where a second sub-woofer is already connected. The only option I could find on the back for an external audio out connection was the headphone jack. I tried plugging my sub-woofer into that jack but because it is labeled as a headphone jack, the tv \"smartly\" disables the on-board speakers and doesn't offer the user the option to do so his or herself. The TV warns you that you have plugged something into the headphone jack and the the speakers turn off. Then I can get some bass through my sub-woofer but now without any sound from the TV. Hmmmmm.... The Samsung at least had not a headphone jack but a labeled audio out jack and didn't disable the internal speakers unless you opted to do so through the options screen. So, now I have to research another way to get sound to my first sub-woofer without the need to turn go through my stereo receiver first.I also noticed people were complaining about the digital fibre optic output and that it didn't pass through the 5.1 audio. I haven't hooked anything up to that yet so I am not going to review or comment further unless I do.All In all, I think the TV so far is awesome and I do say go out and order it or buy it if you have the cash!!!!Update, 1.5 months after purchase....I still go with all the above except now I have tried the 5.1 optical output. I tried playing some dvd video files with 5.1 surroumd sound still encoded and the sound was produced just as it was with the original movies through all 5 speakers. I found that to be awesome!I also don't see where people FREAK out about the saying the resolution is being cut in half when viewing 3D. What exactly do you people feel your eyes are actually capable of detecting when watching television? Geez!! I felt when veiwing 3D, the picture looks every bit as sharp and clear as it did when viewing 2D. Maybe I'm not as picky as some of you but when you expect something more than your own eyes are able to detect in the first place, that is going too far in my book! Just watch it and enjoy!I personally love this television and I personally NOT going to wait a year for some other technology to come out. As far as I am concerned, the next technology will have to be when they make the images holographic and appear in the middle of my living room or viewing area without using any glasses or wearing anything extra for veiwing what-so-ever. Until they master that feet, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have now. Just hope it doesn't blow up on me in the next 5 years or so! :-)"}], "B004PGMFG2": [{"review_id": "a16c03f4e18fb6fee0772ca86e02bea0", "review": "This tablet has exceeded my expectations.

At first glance, they seem pretty big for earbuds, but when you put them in your ear you hardly even notice the size...until you turn on your music - that's when you'll be blown away!  It seriously feels like there are 10\" subwoofers sitting inside your ears!  These seal up really well also so I can't hear anything that's going on around me whenever the music is on; it's awesome!  Not only does the bass pound, but the mids and highs are also crisp/clear at all volume levels.  I've tried all of those high end brands (Klipsch, Bose, Beats, Koss, etc) and these are just as good or better at a fraction of the price!  My biggest disappointment was when I decided to try the Beats that everyone is walking around with these days.  After listening to them compared to these, there is absolutely no way I'd pay close to $200 for a pair of earbuds whose performance doesn't come close to these that are less than $30.  Don't waste your money on the high ends...buy these Xtreme earbuds (or any other JVCs for that matter) and you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "d83d80365613c75b2c1e0e6dae2b105d", "review": "The sound cancellation and quality are awesome on these ear buds.

The TV has to compete with high levels of daytime ambient lighting and reflections. It does so admirably. The panel itself is not of the \"glossy\" type, which lends itself to reducing the reflections that some other displays ( notably plasmas with their glass surface ) have. In a perfect world, the Vizio would have a limited sheen bezel as well, but this is not the case. Piano black and very glossy.Connectability:  A full complement of connections are available and well thought out on this display. If you are going to connect any legacy equipment that requires analog connections you will not have the problem of running out of input jacks. (As a side note, be aware of the lower priced models. Vizio has \"dual purposed\" the component/composit jack pack making that connection an \"either/or\" situation.) A side jack pack is also available and is handy for temporary hookups.Ergonomics:  The remote is a classy little brick. The qwerty keyboard on the flip side proves to be very handy if you search frequently for various programming from your cable/sat provider or Netflix/Vudo or similar. My mother immediately said she would never use the keyboard until she found just how simple it is to use in comparison with the standard \"letter selection\" process normally found as your only option. Well done Vizio. I'd like to see some of the better universal programmable remotes have a qwerty keyboard as well.Side control options are poorly marked as usual, but since very rarely used, quite the norm.The stand has an interesting flaw. When properly connected to the panel itself, the display actually leans back a few degrees from vertical. Since LCD technology still requires us to be pretty much centered in front of the display, I found that I had to modify the stance with the effect of pointing the display to the sight line. Since the Vizio is even a touch fussier than some other makers in this regard, I was surprised at the lack of a swivel/tilt stand on this 3d capable display.Performance:  After making the connections and dialing in the built in wifi for the apps, a pleasantly simply procedure by the way, I immediately noticed the limited viewing angle issue mentioned before. Be aware of this if your seating configuration covers a wide area. Those outside of the somewhat limited \"sweet spot\" will not have the same viewing experience as the front and center crowd. If you are front and center although, a very nice bright image is viewed. The controls are all there if you wish to adjust for various lighting scenarios and as an ISF tech, I was pleased to see a full complement of drives and cuts to dial in the grayscale in the advanced user section. After setting the black and white level controls, I measured the contrast ratio at nearly 600 to one using the checkerboard ANSI pattern. Very decent for a ccfl LCD display. The primary and secondary color points were spot on and after dialing in the grayscale a bit, film DVD/BluRay viewing in a darkened room (evening in this case) proved the display to be quite capable. The 3D capability with the enclosed passive shades was not tested.Conclusion:  A lot of bang for the buck here. It is no wonder the once titans of tv's are scratching their heads. Vizio has a fine display here for a well lighted room with a casual viewer as the target market.d6500k"}, {"review_id": "740873b5c12e422e3bc111a352e0657e", "review": "I already had a Vizio VX37L at home. A also have an old Hitachi CRT TV that's rated 720i resolution (a very uncommon thing for a CRT TV.) I bought the E3D420VX and set it side-by-side with each existing TV one at a time. I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With both types of signals, the old TVs were both noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.One major annoyance was that the E3D420VX takes a long time to come on once the power button is pushed. Perhaps the CCFL backlights need time to warm up??? The VX37L does not have any delay.Finally, I was hoping that with the internet apps, there would be a browser so that I could access general internet features (searches, etc.). But no such luck.I next tried a Vizio E421VO. With the same tests, the results were nearly the same; both the old TVs out-performed the E421VO.I decided to try one more time. So I bought a Vizio M420VT. It's a keeper! The picture is bright, the colors are true, and the 1080i is sharp with no pixellation. With the 480 signals, there is still some pixellation, but it's acceptable if I sit back at least ten feet. So it's time to upgrade my satellite service to HD."}, {"review_id": "4063303c395772e6a12d35459dcd179d", "review": "I actually didn't get this on AMAZON... I purchased it at Target,  but wanted to leave a review here.  We went from a 50 inch plasma, (a monster of a TV that just came out 6 years ago and cost the same as a small used car), to this.  The first thing I noticed was how much lighter it is! The base is a bit flimsy but seems to work just fine.  The picture quality is excellent- and no more burn it like we had with the plasma.  Set up was a snap.  We don't have cable- so hooked up the Blu-Ray player and began checking out Netflix on it. After dealing with macro blocking and burn in with the plasma this was such a joy to watch!  The sound bothers me as it could be better and kind of ruins it... but after adjusting the equalizer and upping the base a bit- it does sound better... not great but tolerable till we purchase a surround sound system.  For the price this TV is amazing! I recommend this for anyone who wants a larger flat screen."}, {"review_id": "588512f41d1c0ee1ea365dc6e5b59596", "review": "After having this TV for almost a year, it's flaws become pretty apparent. The TV is perfect except for the following things.1) Sometimes the letter buttons on the reverse side of the remote will just stop working. So if you are using the built in YouTube, you might find that you have to manually use the arrows to go to each letter on the screen even though you have all these letter buttons on your remote. They just randomly don't work sometimes.2) Netflix is fine, but YouTube and other apps have serious difficulty streaming for extended periods of time. Even on a 50mbit internet connection, the TV can't seem to buffer the video far enough into the future, and videos play extremely choppy. But this seems to happen more on the 3rd or 4th video you watch, almost like the older videos are being stuck in cache somewhere and now the cache is full, so quitting the app and reloading it makes it better for another two videos... it just seems like they didn't test their included Apps. Maybe this app is provided by YouTube and not vizio, but it is still a part of the TV.3) Automatic volume adjust doesn't work after awhile... the volume will be great, and then sometimes the volume auto adjust feature that is supposed to maintain a constant volume on all content gets screwy, and the volume goes up and down and up and down and up and down while watching movies or videos. Extremely annoying. It can be rectified by either turning the Smart Volume off, or resetting to factory defaults (but then it may randomly return). Turning the Smart volume off would be fine, except when you do this, you may find for certain videos or movies, you will turn the tv volume all the way up to 100% and it will still be quieter than it was when the smart volume was working at 30 or 40%. Basically, your overall maximum volume is seriously reduced. I would say this is the most annoying issue of all with this TV, and if I had known this before hand, I would not have purchased this TV unless I had also purchased a separate audio system.4) About once every 2 months the TV just completely freezes, won't turn off or on until you unplug it. Something about the software on the TV I guess, just has some kind of error and if you are watching TV at the time, the picture gets stuck, and the buttons stop working. You need to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Sometimes it happens when the TV is off, and you can't turn the TV on until you unplug it and plug it back in. This happens without rhyme or reason, but it is rare. Still, it is very annoying when it does happen.5) 3D auto detect is a little poor. It detects fine with certain things like PS3 games, but other things like streaming movies it doesn't detect so well. I'm not sure if other TVs are better at this. It could be a fault of the source.Otherwise, this is a pretty nice TV. I do think it was worth the price at the time I bought it, it was very cheap for the included features. The picture is just fine, and it's big, and the 3D looks good."}], "B004T9RR6I": [{"review_id": "917999bb5a3dd00d34af08bed8a28693", "review": "I picked this router because it was either this or Netgear or D-Link (both of which I've had my fair share of gripes using).  It's pretty simple to connect to your modem.  The range is somewhat acceptable, however, I've found through speedtests that the WiFi strength is sporatic.  It's as if it'll go in intervals of very fast to fast (but rarely slow).PROS: Cheap, does the trick, slim enough to hide behind closed doors.CONS: Hooking it up to your modem can be tricky. The CD helps.UPDATE - 4/08/2013: This router made me think of that old saying: \"You get what you pay for.\" The Wifi signal eventually got worse for me and this router.  It didn't matter which channel I flipped it to or where I placed it in my home.  It got to the point where if I didn't have a clear line of sight of the router, I was bound to lose signal.  The only time I got decent Wifi speeds was if I was standing right in front of the routeI eventually returned this item and got a higher end router and my Wifi signal and reach woes disappeared in my home.  This router is great if you want a decent Wifi signal in a small studio apartment. But if you have a small home or bigger, you're either going to have to resort to powerline adapters and/or range extenders to make this router worth the effort.

However, this is a product that takes away your control of your settings locally and sends them to the cloud. This is an idea that may disturb some. I was a little surprised to see I had no choice (when I first got this, the Cisco Connect Cloud wasn't online and the setup location was local, i.e., on my computer). Later I went to check some settings, and after typing in the 192.168, etc. address, I could see I was being redirected to the internet and their cloud. I felt a little cheated, like they took away from me my own stuff and from now on I had to go through them to get it. Still, I went through using it and even downloaded the smartphone app, which was neat to have remote control in my hand (if my son didn't get off when I told him, I could kill his connection from my phone!). Things, however, went bad.For some reason, I stopped being able to get to the cloud at all, from my smartphone or via any computer. I was completely shut out of any router controls. Cisco support is easy to get to, but after many back and forths, and resets and re installs, they still couldn't tell me what was wrong or what I needed to do to fix it. So, we reverted back to the original, locally based router management software. On one hand, I like having control back in my hands, but on the other, I'm not sure Cisco is ever going to update or support the old software (they seem to be headed to the cloud, like it or not).Basically, it works fine as a router and wireless device, but if you don't want to give up control of your setup to Cisco's cloud, you won't like this. If you use the cloud, there is the advantage of being able to do some configuring from your smartphone, but it may not be something you use all the time, either."}, {"review_id": "00167698e78c23dbba29d434d9d79589", "review": "The N300 is an entry level router, but for most people, it will suffice.I've used it to replace my ancient Linksys WRT54G, purchased back in 2008. After running a few speed tests I found that the download speed of the N300 was slightly faster, but the upload was twice as fast. Given that I regularly use Dropbox, that's a major upside.Installation is very straightforward: connected the router to my cable internet modem, popped the installation CD into my Mac, ran the installation program, and after 5 minutes everything was setup. There's one level of customization I would recommend: changing the channel. The default channel for most routers is 1 through 6. I live in an apartment building and there is tons of WiFi floating around, most it on those channels. This can cause interference and disrupt service. I changed the channel to 11 which almost none of the other networks are operating on.The reason I took a star off was because of the power cable. It's horizontally oriented, and as a result, takes up multiple spaces on a surge protector.

Right away, I noticed the range and speed were lower than what I was used to with the WRT45G. My wireless laptop would get 4-5 bars connection strength with the WRT45G, with the E1200 I get 3-4 at most. My download speed fell 6 Mbps (!) according to the speedtest website, though my upload speed was unaffected - I don't download a terrible large amount of stuff or run multiple internet reliant applications at once so this does not have too much impact on me personally at the moment, but it might concern me over time if I increase my internet usage and the speed loss becomes an issue. I know the loss in speed is due to the new router since when I reconnected my old router the speed went back up. There might be settings to \"tweak\" that would improve the speed, but I am admittedly not particularly tech-savvy, and as far as connecting routers go, I follow the basic instructions and leave it at that since it seems to have worked for me that way all these years. The E1200 also runs warmer than my WRT45G. The temperature is not enough to concern me about being \"too\" warm, but it is noticeable, vs what I would call the \"not worth noticing\" temperature the WRT45G used to run at. The E1200 is actually the piece running warmest out of all my Internet devices (Cisco CM100 modem, OBi110) I leave on 24/7.The only real advantage the E1200 has for me over the WRT45G is the appearance. It is nearly 1/2 as thick and much more appealing to look at without the antennae and sleek black exterior. The E1200 router has worked steadily without issues, but since I don't need to worry about appearance so much since I stick all my devices where they can't be seen, I would rather stick to the old WRT45G.One word of advice for when you're setting up the router for the very first time - make sure not to plug the router in and/or connect any cables until you get to the screen (after inserting setup CD and launching) where it tells you to do so.. I jumped the gun and went into it with the router already plugged in and every time the setup would error out. It took me a few times to realize I had to have it unplugged, etc for it to setup correctly (need to practice more patience ^_^;)."}, {"review_id": "6f9e3cde2e4117d94741c8cf3774329a", "review": "(See bottom for update )I have a wired network at the house. We've tried wireless in the past, but the signal won't penetrate the walls (they are 1 \" thick concrete boards). The last try was a few years back, and we really needed to try again. Every piece of electronics we buy has a network connection. I'm tired of running cables, installing hubs, etc.  Xbox, Wii, TV's, BluRay layers, satellite boxes, printers - the list goes on. And so do the network cables.OK, I did have some install issues and had to contact customer support, so this goes on a bit.  Bottom line, after all was said and done, this thing works FANTASTIC. There is one serious security concern - the router automatically had a wide open guest connection. You can't configure this during setup, but have to do it later. ASAP change this - set a password!  Had I not had my install issue, the install would have taken under 10 minutes. On to the review....I'm typing this review as I install the router: Default setup requires that you already have a wireless connection - that's a pretty silly assumption, since you're buying a wireless router. You don't find this out until you start installation. The instructions have you plug in the router, attach it to the internet (to the back of your cable box, etc.)  - then test for a wireless connection. If it does not find a connection, you have to redo step one, move the router next to your PC, unplug your PC from the network, and plug the router into your PC and the web. OK, so I climbed the ladder, pulled the router down from the shelf I stuck it on, and plugged it into the back of my PC with a 100' cable I had on hand.  Followed the instructions on the rest of the setup screen. It's the typical wizard interface, just follow instructions and press \"Next.\" So I kept pressing \"Next.\" After about three minutes I received a message - Big and bold - \"Our Customer Support team can help\" - then about 70% smaller - \"Your router was not successfully set up.\"  You're then pointed to a website for help and chat. Chat. No phone number. OK, so now I need to unplug the router from the back of my PC, reattach my network cable, and visit the website. If you're like me, the computer is under your desk, pretty buried.  It's a real pain to crawl under there and swap cables. Plus you have to clean up all the stuff that missed your trash can.....OK, I follow the link. It's not a help page. It's the promo page for the product. So I have to find support myself. I find live chat. Have to fill out a short form?!  Took about two minutes to start the chat. Typical BS chat questions, asking me everything I just answered on the form I had to fill out to start the chat! Man is that annoying. Plus they want the serial number. They won't even chat without that information. Obvious from the grammar that I'm chatting with a tech-center in the Far-East. Then they want to know how many computers I have and the OS. So I tell them. Then I'm asked which computer was used to install the router. That's the first pertinent question. There's also the annoying 10-20 second gap between my sending an answer and the reply.Next: Do I use DSL and who is my ISP.  Still no question about the error.  Getting really annoyed. No, I do not use DSL. Business class broadband, five dedicated IP addresses.I'm told to (cut and paste - all replies are cut and paste, including typos):1. Reset the router, press and hold the reset button found underneath the router for 5-10 seconds (until the port lights flash at the same time) to reset the router to its factory defaults.2. Temporarily disable the Firewall or Anti-virus on the computer then Run the software. Make sure that the Ethernet Cable from the modem is connected to the Internet port of the router.OK - no reset button on the bottom of the router. Follow her instructions, but I point out that I don't have a wireless connection on my PC.  I'm told I don't need one.Reset router, disable firewall and antivirus.  Install fails. \"This computer does not appear to have wireless capability\"I inform the tech. The reply? \"If this computer is not wireless then it needs to be wired to the router.\"  I told her this before we started.  I feel like throwing something. Like the router.I get a reply: \"We can't proceed with the installation if the router is not yet connected to your modem and this computer is not wired to one of its nummbered ports.\"My reply: Are you saying I have to have the router connected to the modem and my computer to the router? The router is over 100 feet away from my computer.Answer: \"The router needs to be plugged to your modem to work.\"My reply: In other words, yes. So I need to either move a computer, move the modem, or run 100 feet of cable, right?Long delay - two minutes and counting.....three minutesAnswer: \"Yes\"In other words, there was no reason to deactivate the Antivirus and Firewall. And the chat was a complete waste of time. They never asked about the error, just followed a preset script/decision tree, and wasted my time.So no wireless on your PC? You need to connect your PC to the router and the router to the web, you may have some rearranging to do. Fortunately I had that extra cat 5, 100' cable. Why require wireless already be in place? This is idiotic. Bottom line: The Reset on the router was all that was needed. Install now worked.User name and password entered, updated detected and installed. Update took four minutes. Router is installed. Now to try it out! Get rid of that 100' cable, connect my PC to the network again.Well, not so fast. It appears that my PC needs a wireless card to connect directly to the router. It's setup, it's on my network - and I need to use a wireless connection to configure it? Come on!!! Look, not every PC in an office or house is going to be wireless. My configuration/final goal - replace my hubs with wireless hubs, keeping the wired connections to the computers and devices (printers, BluRay players, TV's, etc.) The only wireless devices will be Kindles and a couple of laptops.  So I have to use a wireless device to configure the router. Pathetic.Hmmm. What to do.  Open up my DroidX, download the Cisco Connect Express App, and try that.  While that was going on, I ran the WiFi analyzer app and checked the signal strength throughout the house. Wow! It's strong everywhere. Back of the house, basement, outside. But - Woah! There are two network connections available from the router - a secured connection, and a wide-open guest connection! Gotta turn that off - but I can't connect to the router. Let's try that Droid app. I turned off WiFi to save the battery... Run the app. It requires WiFi (duh) but it can't turn it on for you. So exit the app, turn on WiFi. Try and find the app. It's not under Cisco. It's not under Router. It's called simply \"Express\" - no common sense with these people! So I run the app.\"Router not found.\"  My kindle finds it. The DroidX finds it. The Cisco app on the DroidX can't find it. Appears that you need to manually connect to the network, then run the app. Sheesh. So I check the connections. Hey, I AM connected to the guest connection. Let's switch to the secure connection. Man, time to pay for that 25 character long, upper/lower/numeric combination I set for a password.... Connected to the secure connection. Run the Cisco app again. It asks for the admin password. Enter password. Connected. So the error message was misleading. It should have stated that a secure connection was required.Once the app runs we see:Four options: Guest Access - Wi-Fi settings - Devices - Router ManagementChange the guest settings: Require a password, set max guests. Can't set lower than 4, so I make it 4.WiFi settings: Only allows you to change name and password.Devices:Display connected devices - a list of connected devicesManually add a device - displays the router info - Name, password, securityUse WiFi protected setup - tells you how to use the protected setup button found on some devicesRouter management:Renew IP address - renews IP, asks again when you press the optionReboot - Reboots, asks again when you press the optionFirmware update - Checks for update.Router details - All router info (model #, serial #, IP address, etc.)Hardware: runs a little hot, no way of wall mounting, looks cool and sleek.Included: Cat 5 cable, 6' - Power adapter, router, install CD.Update 4-27-12: Added aTRENDnet 300 Mbps Wireless N 4-Port Media Bridge TEW-640MB (Piano Black)to my network. This bridge has the WPS button, as does the Linksys router. Connecting the two was darn right simple. I pressed the WPS button on the bridge, and used my Droid App to access the EA4500 - pressed the WPS button on the screen. A minute later, I had a secure connection.  Attached two PC's and two printers. Checked the app again - saw all the devices connected.  At first I did not like the idea of using a wireless device to control the EA4500. But, wow, is this handy! I'm crawling around under the desk, Droid in hand, controlling the EA4500, linking to the bridge.  Did the same thing with a webcam.  Love the wireless app!  Just under a month later I returned the Trendnet Media Bridge. Kept dropping the connection, slowinf down - a real pain - and it was located within sight of the router.  Picked up a Netgear bridge instead - works flawlessly.  I'm bandwidth - so I also picked up a Netgear N900 USB wireless adapter.  I constantly get 450 mbps - this is in addition to the connection through the bridge.  I have two simultaneous connections, both wireless. Hitting 550 mbps total.Another update: I had to reset the router. The software that you installed to setup the router will NOT run. You get an error that you reset the router, and that you need to install the software again. WHAT? What if you can't find the CD?  I have never heard of anything this stupid. That cost it a star."}, {"review_id": "52d167f982a274fd85d37903f857966f", "review": "UPDATE (26 June 2012):I got ready to add a USB storage device (Seagate 2TB) to the router and when I launched the router page I was presented with a new screen and asked to create an account for Cisco Connect Cloud.  I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!  Highly recommend!!!"}, {"review_id": "b26b31280dcf1e61d90004e50898b253", "review": "EDIT:  The following post was made earlier and I had another replacement EA3500 sent to me, which continues to have more problems that require rebooting the router a few times a week.  Though Cisco commented on their concern with customer support below, they have no contact info and failed to contact me twice about this post, other than telling me that they wanted my info (which would be broadcasted across amazon).  Again, stay away from this device, and pretty much any device by Cisco/Linksys which uses a Marvell chip.  If possible, only use a Broadcom or other chip which allows for better options in horrible firmware.Original:I'll start by giving my credentials, and after that you can take it as you wish.  I'm Cisco certified and work on networks for a living.  I've owned dozens of routers in the past, and I'm a major fan of Cisco, as I was Linksys.Here's the problem:  Cisco/Linksys created this new line of routers with a chipset that was meant for blocking techies from modifying the firmware/software on it.  As simple as it may seem, the hardware/chips are flawed, and have major issues.With that said, here's what's happened so far:1. In 2 different locations of residence, I've experienced the same issues.2. I've worked with Linksys/Cisco to try to resolve the issue, and I'm on my second one with the issue starting to occur again.3. I've changed channels, equipment and so forth, but Wireless on this device is very, very bad.What are the issues?1. Poor reception on some units.2. Constant disconnecting on most Laptops.3. Major issues when using an Xbox.  If you have an xbox, avoid this router like the plague.  Even when port forwarding and MTU is configured, you will kill connections to ALL other devices on the network.4. \"Auto\" channel is absolutely useless.5. No external antennas.6. Overheats like it's its job, even when in the open.7. Too much \"over simplifying\" for end-users has turned it into a piece of garbage.  Being easy is one thing, but adding a massive amount of trash to an install to make it better, ends up creating more problems in the end.8. No options for Tomato or DD-WRT, as it's locked down.9. Service stinks.  You'll be hours trying to get an RMA if that's even your problem; mine ended up just being that the hardware is horrible.In summary, don't buy this thing.  I had a netgear dual band router that was 10 times the reliability that this is, and it's hard for me to say that, considering I literally work on Cisco equipment all day.  I only switched because lightning burnt up my Netgear and this one was cheaper.  Never again will I make the same mistake.  I promise you, you'll eventually be disappointed in this."}, {"review_id": "8a870294fadf6935d5c8b079ce881ab8", "review": "I bought this to replace an 5 year old WRT-54G.The device looks slick ... but it's in a cabinet ...As always easy setup with Linksys devices. I am glad I read about the local vs. web based setup before I installed it because it was confusing at first.The throughput is much better than the previous router. I don't have numbers but everybody in the house (3 teenagers!# happily streams Netflix and hulu etc. and I still have bandwidth for my work.The previous Linksys routers all had decent parental controls. I could create rules and activate them based on time. This device has extremely rudimentary controls. Essentially not usable. You can't block multiple devices or multiple sites at the same time. The control allow the user to pick on/off times for each rule on a nifty time grid, but each rule can only affect one device or one website.The connected device manager is an improvement over previous versions but it still could be better. I have devices show up multiple times #same MAC#. Some devices don't show up #only 4 of 5 Sonos components show up). I like that I can name each device and give it icons.I really like the GuestNet feature. Super easy to set up. Your guest just connect to your network and automatically get asked a password (which you can set, and which is NOT your regular Wifi password) and they're connected to the internet but NOT your network. I like this for three reasons: 1) I can change my guest network if I'm worried about neighbors or WiFi hijackers. 2) I can make my regular WiFi password much more complicated and thus stronger because my guests don't have to type it in; and 3) My guests can't get access to my files so I can remove one level of password protection from my networked computers. This is a great feature.Things I would like to see improved:The web interface is incompatible with IE11 !!! Had to re-install Google Chrome!!!The interface WAN speed check app is iPad incompatible! It's flash based.The parental controls need to be improved. I would like to see the ability turn multiple devices or websites on and off at different times. Then I would like to see a master list of rules with an on/off button next to them. I have three daughters each with a computer, phone and ipod. Each has different needs for internet access because their school times are different and website access and times are different for different ages.The speed check utility needs to run on ipads.The device list manager needs to work more reliably, i.e. show all devices and then only once.I would really like to see a network map.Guest Network is great! I would love to see an email notification service so I get emails when guest sign in or out. Similar to my NAS sending me error messages.Overall I think this is a well functioning device. I am a very advanced and picky user. I have had good luck and experience with Linksys and cisco hardware. I have not really found better parental controls. I hope Linksys can improve that some."}, {"review_id": "817c91856958c1c025043233690aca37", "review": "I started using this router - the beginning of August, 2012. I had heard that the new software (Cisco Cloud Connect) was very intuitive and easy to use, despite some early controversy about it.  By the way, many of the 1 star reviews are based on concerns about privacy that have been put to rest by the manufacturer.This router is among a select few \"state of the art\" routers offering multiple but simultaneous operation on both the 2.4 and 5.0GHz bands - each band is capable of 3 streams (connections). This is a so called 900 router (the current gold standard for home routers).Much has been written about the new software - some of which was full of praise (including a glowing CNET review) and some of which is quite damning (including many 1 star reviews here on Amazon). The bottom line is that this software is wonderfully easy to use and any concerns that Cisco might be monitoring your internet activity have been put to rest by the manufacturer. Cisco has revised and clarified their policies to make it abundantly clear that this is a NON ISSUE. See Cisco's remarks posted right here on Amazon. So many of these 1 star reviews are quite dated.Also remember that Cisco allows you to opt out of this software altogether and administer your router locally with no connection to Cisco or the cloud (internet).What we have here is a \"top of the line\" advanced router that is very easy to set up thanks to its intuitive software.  That is exactly what I wanted ---- because routers can be quite difficult to setup/manage, particularly the very best (and most advanced) ones. The EA 4500 is very easy to setup and is a true \"set and forget\" type of device.So, what is not to like? The software and router are great and the fact that it can be managed in the cloud (meaning the router can be accessed via the internet) is largely unimportant. You will, most likely, just like me, simply set it up (using all or most of the simple software defaults) and forget about it! But for those of you who have the rare need to manage a router once it is set up , then you can access your router via any internet connection if you have passed Cisco's extensive security measures.As of August, 2012, the other competing routers you should look at are the Asus RT-N66U, WD (Western Digital) N900 and the Netgear R6300. I based my choice on Cisco's very intuitive software and very good range. While it may not always be the best (according to professional reviews), it has a better than average range.What may confuse many future buyers is that there is a new DRAFT (meaning far from finished) standard that is coming to Wi-Fi and routers. You will see, no doubt, many new routers coming to market boosting of conformance to the \"draft\" or the unfinished AC standard (802.11ac). The fact that NO clients (meaning there is NOT ONE real world receiving device) that exists for this new and yet to be finished standard is never pointed out. While meaningless, every router manufacturer will start to bring out new devices, or firmware upgrades to claim  \"compliance\" to this new DRAFT standard of AC. You can, at least for the next couple of years, largely ignore this spec.If you want a high performance router that simultaneously operates on both bands, can easily handle 3 simultaneous signals per band and works with all current standards and devices - then this is the one for you. If you want a set and forget type of device that is easy to setup ---this is also the one for you. Highly recommended.I should add this router also creates a GUEST network (a network that can never access your home files).Yet, if friends come over, they will be greeted with an easy Wi-Fi connection. You can turn off this feature easily in the setup but it is a real convenience that most people will like.  Frankly, I doubt there will be many that turn it off since it is both secure and really convenient for guests. Yet to be fair, most other new high end routers now also offer this same feature. So it is not unique to this router yet a welcome addition to the feature set of most newer high end routers.I'm hesitant to give performance figures. What I can say is that I have a large home. This router is located on the second story of my home, in the north most corner. I routinely connect on the first floor, on the south most corner, with excellent results. By accident, I had created a worse case scenario - yet I get top-notch results. There may be even better performing routers available but I'll take the easy set-up of this one versus all comers.I guess you could say I am happy with my purchase."}, {"review_id": "17cd34b916891b9431711f69cc45b66a", "review": "The Linksys EA2700 is a good midrange router. If your only goals for it are connecting wirelessly with your phone, tablet, or laptop it should perform flawlessly.I tried to set it up as someone who is not too familiar with routers. The instructions that come with basically say to insert the included CD into your computer, plug the router into your computer, and then follow the prompts. This is what I did and the entire process was painless. Everything worked perfectly when I disconnected the cable and attempted to connect wirelessly. I then proceeded to add the router to my phone's wifi and my tablet's wifi. Everything connected without a hitch. The only surprise was the the process of setting up the router took about ten minutes. Granted almost all of that time was spent staring at my laptop waiting for the software to finish (no interaction required from me). Still... It took longer than expected.If you're familiar with good ol' 192.168.x.x then that works fine too. If that made no sense, don't worry about it, the included software takes care of everything for you.Personally, I feel that there is not much that is worth the premium price for the router. It's not that it's bad--it's just not amazing.Apparently, there is an Android app that is available that can also adjust settings but, for the life of me, I can't see how that's very useful. Instead, I wish it included a USB connector so I could print wirelessly. That's becoming a common feature in \"better than low end\" routers, these days.On the plus side, the setup software is easy and it's attractive. I like the internal antenna design and haven't noticed any degradation of signal compared to my other two routers (both with dual external antennas)."}], "B004U78J1G": [{"review_id": "598f77be1fcb0147ee763a1699267d68", "review": "I have been an iPad user for more than a year now. I had been in line toget it the very first day it was offered and while it is an adequate device for meia consumption it has its flaws. Things that I was willing to live with on a smaller screen just bothered me too much on iPad. The really small amoutn of RAM was also something that immediately caused issues (it has 256 Mb of RAM half of what is available on iphone 4). I had been waiting for Another tablet device to fix teh issues with iPad and Asus seemed to have delivered. A battery life that was comparable to iPad. An OS that was designed from the ground up for tablet (honeycomb) and an accessory (dock) that seemed to fix everything the device was lacking (keyboard, extra battery, extra expansion ports). On the surface Asus Transformer is an excellent replacement for iPad.It is, however, not a perfect device yet. I 'll admit majority of the issues are software related and should be fixed with the next release (Icecream sandwich). The Tegra processor is fast and 1GB of memory is enough to open a lot of pdfs without any issue. The screen is gorgeous and the soft touch back makes it easy to hold. 10.1\" 16:9 ratio screen however is a bit unwieldy but since this is the resolution every Android tablet (to date) has; it is not something you can fix by getting another device. To me 4:3 screen of iPad makes it easy to hold in any orientation and Android tablets' 16:9 screen make it more suited for landscape use.I am still not a fan of multitasking the way either iOS or Android do however, Honeycomb does it better than iOS. There is still a lack of tablet specific apps (even after 3 months) but I have been able to find apps for everything that I usually use my tablet for. That said some notable exceptions are Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flipboard or Zinio (I am using \"your version\" as a replacement which is pretty good).I am pretty impressed with the sound coming out of this tablet which is stereo and generally better than iPad.

On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it.  Seems like it couldn't quite keep up with her typing.  It doesn't seem to be the keyboard but the A500 that was the limiting factor, because I used the keyboard on a normal laptop, and didn't notice any lag.I still really like using the A500 over having to use a normal laptop like I was before, it is just so much nicer that it is always on and I can just hit the power button and go!  Still very happy with this purchase.END UPDATE**********************I bought this the week it showed up in a brick and mortar store near me.  I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer.  I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome.  When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected.  I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720).  This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound.  I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well.  The display is fine, good, but not great.  I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone).  The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better.  The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side.  I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison.  Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience.  The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet.  As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me.  Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1\" screen).  I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI.  I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet.  Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone.  I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine.  I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great.  Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away.  The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly.  I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates.  First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500.  It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something.  I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem.  I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine.  So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use.  I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this.  It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on.  This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on.  And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app.  I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature.  I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning.  As the software updates came along, it worked much better.  Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area.  The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much.  I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2.  I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me.  I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500."}, {"review_id": "2de613c1f7e7a87349f3e639c896e131", "review": "The first thing I did with this Acer was take it on an international flight and drop it onto a hardwood floor at a restaurant in the airport.

This isn't really surprising, it's just the nature of integrated graphics in an OS with a lot of visual bells and whistles.* When it's hooked up to a display via HDMI, the Mini outputs in YPbPr rather than the full RGB color space. This causes some weirdness in color reproduction and there's no way in OSX to force it to output in RGB.

I listen to podcasts while I'm riding.  This headset with it's snug silicone ear buds block out wind noise better than my other headset (Backbeat), but I can still hear traffic well enough.  The battery life is great, the around-the-neck design works fine, and the controls work well with my Android except for:... I'll 'pause' the audio for whatever reason and then restart it with 'play' (both on the headset) and every once in a while some other audio will start playing -- like instead of continuing the podcast, some other podcast or some song will start.  I'm guessing this is some setting in Android, but I don't really know, and when it happens I'll have to pull over and take the phone out and find right app and find the thing I was listening to again, and get that playing again.  I haven't figured out if the headset is sending sloppy button signals, or the phone is just timing out, or what's going on.  It happens maybe 1 out of 10 times.  The Backbeat has the same problem (actually, worse).My last headset had microphone noise suppression for calls (I think it had two mics and did waveform subtraction) and I could talk to people in full wind or street noise and they didn't even know I was outside.  This mic doesn't have that, and people on calls with me always complain about the wind noise, so I have to slow way down or stop and walk.This is still a fantastic headset, and at a great price ($45).  If they would add microphone noise suppression like my other one, I would happily pay double for this.  Aside from that, this is still a fantastic headset.One other thought: this headset has the plug-in (to the ear) ear buds that form an air-tight seal.  Around the office I prefer the Backbeats because they sit in the ear and don't make the air-tight seal, so I can hear the office noises and people better.  In a busy environment, or if you don't want to be bothered, the LG's might be better, because the LG's isolate you much better.Was this review ..."}, {"review_id": "3e5539729491de95b79d99b8a18f205c", "review": "This headset is perfect for my needs.

It also will split connection between various devices, one for phone audio, another for media audio.  I have other bluetooth devices which will accept both inputs from multiple sources simultaneously.  That feature would be the best possible improvement for this unit.Other than that issue (which is a derivative of my usage of it) it meets or exceeds my expectations.  Battery life is quite reasonable, I use it for several hours every day, and only have to charge it every other day.  Once it's on my neck, I quickly forget that it's there.

I have had them for about half a month and used them very often. I walk to campus about every day to go to class and I hear music with these. It has been a great upgrade from any wired headphones and there is no wire to mess with.Audio:Audio is basic for stereo headphones. There is nothing amazing about the base in these headphones. I have mixed the settings alot on the headphones and my phone to see what is the best I can get from the headphones. With the seetings at it's best the headphones are about basic for audio quality. I've gotten better quality sound from $15 Skullcandy headphones (Skullcandy Ink'd S2INBI-UB).Phone usage:Used them every once and a while to answer phone calls and the quality is actually great. I am heard clearly and I can also hear clearly too. The volume that you can get with these headphone is amazing. Very loud, so be careful how high you have the volume.Conection:I have been very disapointed with the conectivity of these headphones. It is rated for about 30 ft range and my headphones cut out at about 10 ft. Also when I look down, most time to see what I am doing or where I am walking, the headphones cut out. I've held the left side of the base of the headphones and aperantly there is a deathgrip in signal there.Pros:+ Great quality+ Earbuds have magnets that connect it to the base when not in use+ Vibrate and ring when call comes in (even is cell is on silent)+ Very light+ Can be very load+ Clear call qualities+ Great battery life (last me all day of ussage)Cons:- Poor audio quality- Connection limits- Deathgrip on the left side- Somestimes a little too loudGreat for what it is as a bluetooth headset for a phone, but needs to improve audio quality for it to be a great set of headphones.I would've rated these as a four star but since they are advertised as stereo headsets. It needs alot of improvement to get good ratings. I rate them as three star as headphones, but I rate them as four star as bluetooth headphones. Much better than those that just go in one ear."}, {"review_id": "8ebc9799c2b7e8adce044a5cd4a2b292", "review": "I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.  This wireless headset is the most comfortable set of headphones, of any kind, that I've ever used.  It's a little odd looking, yes, but function and comfort are my priorities in this case.  In fact, I chose the white version because I want it to be obvious to those around me that I have headphones on, and I'm not ignoring them or talking to myself!  I can pull out one ear bud, if someone is speaking to me and I don't have to deal with a long tangled cord to retrieve it and pop it back into my ear.  This is one reason I like this design so much: the cords are short and easy to manage.Honestly, I don't get what the magnetic spots are about?  I only seat the earbuds in the little magnetic pods when I'm hanging them up to charge, if ever.The majority of the product sits around the back of your neck (if I'm wearing it right), so the weight is not on your head or ears, and you barely notice the thing is there at all.  I wear it around my neck,let the ear-buds dangle; when a call comes in, the headset vibrates, and I can quickly pop one or two of the buds in.  There is a button on the left side to answer/hangup. People on the other end tell me the sound is great, even when I'm in a noisy room, or on a windy patio.  The volume control is also on the left side, as is the on off toggle, and the charging port.  I like that this product comes with an actual plug-in AC cord, not another USB thing that needs a special adapter or computer to charge it. Also (I think) the port looks like a common generic mini-usb size, that should be easy to replace if you lose the original.  I hate all those propriety cords!I bought these mostly, so I could pair it with my iPad and watch TV or Movies, while in a room with others who don't care to listen to what I'm watching.  I can get up and walk away, wash some dishes and continue listening without being tethered by wired headphones.  It's especially nice for news shows, where you can keep following without even needing to see the visual at all.It was easy to pair up with my ipad or iphone.  Just turned on the bluetooth on my devices settings, the LG headphones appeared in the list, and I clicked \"connect.\"  Within seconds, I heard a few little beeps in my ear, confirming the headset was connected.  The few times that it didn't connect right away, I simply flipped the on/off switch (on the left side of the headset)once or twice, and my device suddenly connected to it.The sound quality is just great for phone calls or listening to a TV show or Movie.  No interference issues whatsoever.  Nice and clear.  Love the controls right there on either side of your collarbone.I didn't get these to listen to music, or even make phone calls, but I like them so much that I use them for both of those functions quite often.  With regular headphones, I hate having to look at the screen and swipe/tap to pause, jump to the next song, or change the volume. Somehow I always accidentally tap something I didn't mean to! But I've discovered that I can control my iPhone without even looking at it, (repeat or jump to the next song) by using the controls on the headset.  FYI: the round button on the right side will Play/Pause music on your iphone/iPad even if you weren't already listening to music.  The rocker type control on the right side will jump forward/ repeat/ jump backward to the next song on the playlist, or in your music library.As far as the sound quality goes for music-listening:  eh. shrug. I'm not sure.  It's fine, is all I can say.  Not awesome.  Not tin-ey.  But I don't think they sound as good as my skull-candy earbuds for cranking up the music.  It's not what I bought these for, so I have no complaints.  I don't want to crank up anything when I'm wearing these, since I need to be aware of what is going on around me, when I'm watching my son, driving or shopping.  (Don't get all fired up now ... I rarely listen to music on headphones when I'm driving!  But I DO use them to hear driving directions from my iPhone, without having to turn down the car stereo, or bother other passengers in the car).I was pretty skeptical when I ordered the LG headset, but after using it for a few weeks now ... it's definitely a keeper.  I love them!  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars, is because the sound quality is fine, but it would be nice if it was great. But minus one star for the lousy instructions. I don't even remember if there was an instruction sheet provided.  But I do recall having to just wing-it and figure out the operation on my own.  FYI for those also wondering: Charge them up first, it doesn't take long.* LEFT SIDE: on/off swith, charging port, volume rocker and phone controls.* RIGHT SIDE: Music controls: Play/Pause Button.  Back/Next Song Rocker.Hope that helps someone!"}, {"review_id": "3899d8a67f7fb300207337c7376d2dc4", "review": "Well, have had this thing for a couple of days now.Been doing lots of testing with it in various configurations, drivers, BlueTooth adapters, etc via phone, voip on computer and cell... bottom line is this:SOUND QUALITY (ie: in your ear)- Music : GREAT- Computer Sounds and Video : GREAT- Bluetooth connected calls : Tinny and Shallow; no warmth, fullness or body to the voiceCALL QUALITY (ie: calling someone else on it)- Cell via Bluetooth : Tinny, but liveable.- Computer via Bluetooth : Very Tinny and no mids/lows, no warmth or body to the voiceCALL QUALITY (TO THE PERSON YOU ARE CALLING... the IMPORTANT PART) - TERRIBLE!And I quote here from some of my calls over the past 2 days with it:- You sound like you are talking through a Paper Towel or Toilet Paper Tube- You sound like you are in another universe, and I can hear everything and everyone around you too.Bottom line for me, given the amount of time that I spend on conference calls, and want a comfortable headset, AND more importantly, that the person on the other end of the call can hear me CLEARLY and PLAINLY without sounding muffled, in a well, echo chamber or via a Paper Towel Tube...So far NOT a happy camper with this one,I LOVE design of this, but need a much more superior call quality to the caller, and thats where this one falls short.I may see if its usable for my son on his PS3, but for use in a professional situation... this is a no go.>>>>> UPDATE NOV 7, 2012 >>>>>1. I did try it out with my son's PS3...- It did connect.- It did work within the games for communication to the other remote players in the game- It WILL NOT also work to route 100% of the GAME SOUNDS and GAME AUDIO to the device.  Note:  This is NOT a limitation of the device, its the audio implementation on the PS3 consoles.  To route GAME AUDIO and In-Game Communication to a wireless headset, you need $250-500 bucks for the high end and uber-expensive Turtle Beach rig.2.  After lots of trial and error and comparing notes with those in the office that have one also...- The device that you are connecting it to, and its Bluetooth audio capabilities have A LOT to do with the call quality of it.- Via a computer with NATIVE Bluetooth or an aftermarket Bluetooth USB adapter... its still not going to sound as good as a Plantronics Blutooth device that has a custom audio functionality built in.  My Plantronics BT300M sounds like you are right there as far as your vocals to the person on the other end of the call.  It sounds like you.  It doesn't sound like a highly compressed tin can.  The LG HBS700 on the other hand... you are in a compressed, metallic sounding mode.- The device via a cell phone depends on the cell phone.  I recently switched from an LG handset to a Samsung Galaxy SIII and that made a HUGE difference.  The LG sounded tinny.  The Samsung sounds wonderful and realistic.Bottom line, this thing WEARS like a dream.  Battery life is incredible.  Music plays wonderfully.

It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted.

These are the VS247H-P 23.6 inch displays.About the stand. It is not up to the job. If your desk is rock solid it will hold the monitor, but if you have desks that shudder every time someone passes by, or when you nudge it inadvertently, the monitor will wobble annoyingly. Dell does have solid stands on the monitors they sell. So when I ordered the second I didn't bother attaching the stand. Instead I removed the &#34;neck&#34; and attached both monitors to a two monitor VESA compliant stand:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9HQLI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Now they are both rock solid (or at least as solid as the cheap desk they're on). If you get a single monitor consider one of the monitor stands Amazon sells for single displays.Haven't attempted the rebate process. I'll report back on that."}, {"review_id": "75b9817a76f347297cf775559ede50fa", "review": "This monitor is just plain awesome.

They both just happen to fit perfectly. Knowing that extended exposure to heat is one of the easiest ways to burn out your hardware, I thought I would be proactive and try this setup.

That is left to be seen.The design of the fan itself is great. It is flat, which is one of the design features that I was particularly looking for. The fan has a connected usb to connect to a power source but what is really cool is that there is a female usb connector on the backside of the fans male usb connection, allowing you to still utilize your usb port. The fan feels rugged and uses hard plastic for the lower components and a metal grill for the top surface. This is an important feature because there are tons of cheap fans on the market that can literally collapse under the weight of a laptop computer which is simply ridiculous.The fan is black so matches most setups aesthetically.It also uses one big single fan, rather than a series of smaller sized fans. The most ideal setup for this type of product is to have one mid size fan in the middle with a smaller size fan at each of the four corners. These fans are obviously more expensive but this is really the optimum design to cool your electronic devices.

Being an early adopter (I own one of the first 2000 units sold in the US), and owning three Roku players in total, I can say that I am a heavy user and a true believer.  I love the freedom of choice in content the Roku player gives you, with over 100 channels to chose from, including the ubiquitous Netflix streaming catalog, access to Amazon's vast catalog of movies, Crackle, Epic, Break!, Pandora and many, many more.  Some channels are subscription based, while others are free.  However, the abilities of the newest generation of Roku players, the Roku 2, also support 3D graphics and gaming, presented in the form of the now-familiar, downloadable \"app\".  From simple games like Reversi and Mahjongg, to Chess and Angry Birds, the Roku 2 is poised to compete with the likes of the Wii, though that time may still be some distance in the future.  However, right now Angry Birds can be yours for free when you purchase a new Roku 2 player.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds, right?Compared to the original Roku player (now the HD model) and the 2nd gen XDS model, the newest hi-end Roku player, the Roku 2 XS, takes its place at the top of the line-up with authority.  The XS unit does everything the other Roku 2 players can do, plus it comes with USB and Ethernet ports, which the two lower end models don't have, though all models of Roku player are wireless capable.  In addition, with the XS model, you receive a motion control remote (think Wii), which can double as a game-pad when you turn it sideways.  To go with this fancy new remote, you also get a free copy of Angry Birds!  The remote control alone MSRPs for $30.00 if you buy one separately, making its addition to the XS package a real value, in my opinion.  Free Angry Birds is just icing on the cake.With a MicroSD card you can expand the storage capabilities of the Roku 2, allowing you to install more games, and presumably, other content in the future.  Best of all, this is a standard feature on all Roku 2 players.  I did have a little trouble inserting my 2GB MicroSD card the first time.  I figured out that you have to push the card into the slot a lot further than I was expecting, requiring a good finger nail to get it in far enough to click into place.  Once I got that figure out, no further problems using the SD card slot have become apparent.  You will be prompted upon boot-up to format a new SD card, which is the only way to tell you have a memory card installed, as far as I can tell.  After seeing the prompt to format the MicroSD card and confirmation of a successful format, you never see anything else about the MicroSD card ever again.  I assume mine is still working, but I have no way to tell.  It would be nice to see something in the settings menu regarding the external SD card, maybe showing used/free space and mounted/un-mounted status.The 2GB MicroSD card I am using (Kingston brand) was purchased with the Roku 2 XS and an HDMI cable directly from Roku.  I believe the Roku 2 will support larger than 2GB SD cards, but there is nothing in the documentation about it.  I am trying to get verification of this before I try a larger MicroSD card.As for performance, I couldn't be happier.  Content loads quickly and runs seamlessly.  I have a 6Mbps DSL line and have little trouble streaming from two Roku players at the same time, both using my wireless router for access to the Internet.  The Roku players take a little while to boot up, however, they pretty much stay on all the time, so this point isn't terribly significant.  On the other hand, none of the various Roku player models have an on-off switch, which I personally don't like.  I want to turn my electronics off when not in use.  I'd really like to see Roku add a power switch to their players.  I have my XDS player plugged into the back of my surround receiver, which in this case is a switched plug.  When I turn the receiver on or off, the Roku player also gets turned on or off.  The other players are plugged into regular outlets, so I actually have to unplug those to turn them off, which can be rather inconvenient where power outlets are not readily accessible.You can use multiple Roku players in your home without interference from each other.  Do be aware, however, that any Roku remote will work with any Roku 2 player.  This has positive and negative aspects, though I'd say mostly positive.  For the most part, there is little reason to have more than one remote at this time, but I fully expect games developed in the future to support multiplayer, making additional remotes a must for those interested in gaming on the Roku 2.  You have to pair the new remote with the XS, and I had trouble with this at first, but I think it's because there was another standard Roku remote in the room during setup.  After removing the batteries from the older remote and rebooting the Roku 2 XS, I was able to make a successful pairing using the manual pairing option from the settings menu.  The new remote works well for standard Roku menu controls, but it really shines when you try it out with Angry Birds.  It is a little twitchy at first, but you quickly get used to the sensitivity.  It would be nice to see an addition to the settings menu for adjusting the sensitivity of the motion controller, but it isn't too bad at its default setting.  With a little practice, you'll be flinging those birds exactly where you want them!Overall, the Roku players have been a great addition to my entertainment options at home.  There is room for improvement, but I believe Roku has the best product offerings even so.  From the first Roku player with nothing but Netflix, to the current generation of Roku players supporting Angry Birds, Roku has made a real winning multimedia product.  Streaming media is only just now coming into full swing, and the Roku players have made much of it possible from the very beginning.  I am the happy owner of three Roku players, and I love them all.  I would heartily recommend them to all of my friends and family, many of whom are already Roku customers."}, {"review_id": "42ecff41dad5473bf49f02053154c5f2", "review": "We love this little box.

I already have an Amazon Prime membership, mostly for quicker shipments.  But of course, with Prime, you also get a lot of free movies.Now, I'm not saying that the movies from THIS service are necessarily better than the movies from than THAT service -- there are probably more films available right now from THAT service for sure -- but, it is getting close enough that it was time to stop paying the seven bucks a month.But there was another issue.  I have a streaming box from, well, you know who.  Now, I really like their devices.  I have a phone, a tablet, and a streaming box from them (similar to Roku).  But they don't let you install apps on that device, and there is no pre-built app for Amazon's streaming service.  So, that required me to buy a new Roku box, which comes preloaded with an Amazon streaming app.  (No no.  Jailbreaking, even if it would work, is a horrific idea from a security standpoint.)I almost made the mistake of ordering the \"wrong\" Roku box from Amazon.  When I initially looked at the quick spec list, I was disappointed since it didn't appear to me that any of them had both wireless and wired Internet capabilities.  But luckily, I stuck with it and realized that the most expensive box was the ONLY one that had ethernet.  This is important to me because, while I have a wireless network, it is of course almost always better to connect your devices through wires, particularly through Gigabit ethernet, which I have throughout my house.The setup was relatively easy, although the hardest part:  getting the batteries in the remote!  The battery relase button must be pushed down; I have to say that I think that this is the first time I've ever seen this.  After that, it was just some quick registration with a couple of web sites to enable movie playback.First movie:  \"Marnie.\"  Now, I reviewed that film on this site, and while I didn't completely like it (you may read my review to see why), the digital transfer was fantastic.  And it looked amazing through my new Roku box through HDMI to my 1080P Sharp Aquos.  (I know, I know.  I want a new 4K TV with 2160P, but they're WAYYY to expensive right now.)  And I have to say:  I actually like the UI in the Roku maybe a little better than the box from, err, that other company.  The remote on the Roku is a little more awkward though.A fairly strong recommendation here, particularly if you are in the same boat as I."}, {"review_id": "23751399280433060ea46cb7b51d5c03", "review": "We have the 1st gen Roku and now the Roku 2 XS. We enjoy all it has to offer so much that we plan to cut our cable TV provider out of the loop at the end of the month. With Roku's ability to stream from sources like Netflix and Hulu Plus, we have our fill of TV episodes, and there are plenty of movie sources too.In this market, none of the selections are perfect at this point. Some competitors don't offer Hulu Plus, some are difficult to use and setup, some come and go within a few weeks. And the Roku is no exception. It has a few issues too.We run into a few stutters and freezes every once in a while - including the Roku box crashing and resetting. This is probably the channels themselves, but it is still a pain.While the interface is clean and user friendly, it could probably use a facelift to speed it up. Instead of apps all being on one line, it would be nice if they were placed on rows. My channel list is growing. In addition, many apps would benefit from a keyboard capability on the remote. Fortunately, the iPhone apps can provide this capability in some cases. But having it built into the Roku and remote would be nice.The only major disappointing issue is the lack of streaming from DLNA or network shares. You can plug a USB drive in, but you can't just stream from a share on the same network. Why not? Seems that Roku would have taken all the begging from customers into consideration and added such a feature. Many of their competitors offer the feature. There are a few workarounds, but they are a pain in the rear to setup and don't work as well as they could.Hopefully the Roku firmware can and will be updated to accept more filetypes and to support the network drives. But there is no telling at this point.But with those issues noted, the Roku was still the best bet compared to the competitors. At least for us. Hulu Plus is a big draw since many of the shows we like are on it (and many of the competing products that have the \"extras\"we want, don't offer Hulu PLus). The simplicity is a necessity. It's nice that the Roku uses very little power consumption. And the abundance of channels is great.In addition, the kids enjoy the game capabilities, but I don't think it will be replacing our game consoles any time soon.Overall, we are very pleased with the Roku and will be getting rid of our cable TV provider in favor of the streaming apps in the Roku device.

First, I wanted to be able to stream movies and show that I have stored locally on my network.  In addition,I wanted to be able to view HBO GO and Netflix movies on a bedroom TV.  I selected the XS model because I wanted the wired connection.  This thing is great.  It took less than 2 minutes to set it up and go to the channel store.  5 minutes later I had Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, and Plex installed along with a few more that I had never heard of but caught my interest.  Each one of these was easy to set up.  Plex is the one that allows me to stream locally stored movies and tv shows from a network server.  I have Plex set up on a computer in my home office.  It goes out onto the web and locates movie posters for shows and movies.  The ROKU Plex app displays the movies and shows using these posters.  The interface is solid and smooth and everything has worked flawlessly so far.  My bedroom TV is an older plasma with no HDMI inputs.  I had no trouble using a cable with HDMI on one end and DVI on the other for video that fits my TV.  The ROKU also has a video/audio output that uses an included cable to output an old fashioned SD yellow video, with red and white stereo audio outs.  I used the audio outputs from this jack along with the HDMI to DVI video for 720 video (the best that TV has).  I was worried that plugging in one of the cables would disable the other, but there was no issue.

Got rid of my 85.00 mo. satellite bill and subscribed to netflix and playon for 15.00 a month, both of which have a ton of hidden channels so I get all the shows except one I always watched, and I can watch it online.  My hubby got an LG hdtv with apps and we were impressed.  After I read about roku, I purchased a LG hdtv without apps and hooked a roku to it and its superior to the one with apps now.  Netflix especially works better with roku.  After 3 mos. my hubby decided he wanted a roku since I was getting way more programming. Upon checking out roku I found the roku 2 available and we ordered the xs model with the Angry Birds on it.  It is a bit smaller than the original roku, has a place for a micro-mini sd card expanding the memory so you can add more roku channels then usual.  I really liked that!  The setup was great, it updated immediately and wirelessly with no problem 2 rooms away from my router.  I bought an ethernet cable in case the update wirelessly hit a snag, as it did on the LG, but didn't need it.  PLug in the electric cord, hook the hdmi cable to the tv and roku, turn it on and let it update and follow on screen instructions.  Simple!  I was surprised that  I could add all the same channels on his roku as on mine without having to activate the channels.  I knew netflix allowed 6 tvs in the same home on one account, but didnt know roku would let you add another roku without all the hassel of activations.  The only channel I had to activate separately was epix.  It is a 14 day free trial deal, so each account must be on a separate email account and each device activated separately.  I did activate netflix on the roku because the movie images are much larger then on his hdtv and his eyesight isnt the best.  It makes it a lot easier for him to select a movie.  This roku lets you use the ethernet cable or wireless.  It has the Angry Birds which loads after update.  My only complaint is that I cannot get round one of the Birds to work.  It loads and starts but I can't get any action.  Im not familiar with this game so will have to do some research on this.  The remote is better on the roku 2.  Its rounded instead of square, the arrow keys are more defined, it has a separate ok button.  It has 2 extra buttons, A and B to use when playing the game.  The instruction booklet is very poor concerning the birds.  No instruction on how to play the game or what those two buttons do.  The remote is similar to a wii, you wave it and the cursor moves to where you want it.  I may not have gotten a good install of the game so I will remove it and reinstall and see if that works.  This is a much improved device for 99.00.  Locally, the old rokus are being sold for the same prices, no discount.  May as well buy the new improved for 99.00 as an older model without the improvements for the same price.  This is an excellent gift, especially for anyone trying to save money in the bad times.  I can't see how anyone would not at least cutback on cable/satellite if not disconnecting altogether."}, {"review_id": "88b546f5b8fa30b9f25dfbb601c83658", "review": "My apartment complex used to pay for basic cable. That quit about 5 months ago. I didn't want to pay the $30 or more per month to get the half dozen channels that I actually wanted so I started looking at streaming players. I already used netflix so that was a must have feature and I decided to pick up hulu plus as well. What drove me to the roku though wasn't just the compatibility with the services that I knew I wanted to use, but the breadth of channels and other content that I could access (for free) from the device.Since purchasing the device I've fallen even more in love with it. The channel store is very nice it has all kinds of web based content to fill the void left by leaving cable behind. From free things like TED talks, news channels (ABC, CNN, CBS, BBC, etc), you tube, pandora, and vimeo videos. To pay channels like HBO go (which I'm \"borrowing\" a password for from a friend). I don't tend to play games on the roku, but have tried angry birds and it is entertaining and I could certainly see younger kids enjoying the gaming experience on the roku.I was afraid that I would miss out on picture quality by having to stream from online, but from what I can tell the picture quality is full HD. I even get surround sound on many of the movies and shows that support it. Of course you can turn the quality of the video down and this may become an important feature for some users. I went from using south of 30GB of data per month to closer to 250GB per month when I switched all of my TV service to the roku. As long as you don't have a cap this is fine, but if you do have a low data cap this is something to consider. Most services (Netflix, Hulu, etc) allow you to pick the picture quality from their websites, but there is also a master switch in the roku options menu if you want to turn quality down across the board.The interface of the roku itself is quite simple and intuitive. The channel store could be set up more nicely as it doesn't currently have a search feature, but you can also look at the available channels online and send them to your roku from there. In fact this is the only way to get some of the unlisted channels which carry things like streaming news casts from different parts of the country and other content which isn't provided by any of the media conglomerates.The interface of some of the other apps are better than others. Netflix does come with a nice search feature, but doesn't let you customize the homepage to show the genres that are most important to you. The Hulu Plus homepage will organize episodes or entire series by name or popularity. This can be especially nice when you want to watch recent TV as new episodes are usually the most popular and will drift towards the front of the list. On the other hand the TED talks app has no search feature and only contains about 1/10 the talks that are featured on their website. But I can't fault the device itself for this as these apps are created by third parties.If I did have one complaint for the Roku 2 XS it would be with the remote. And its a very minor complaint. I have a logitech harmony remote which i use to control all of my media components and while it works with most items very well, and does support the roku 2 XS it is not as strong as the regular remote signal. I haven't had any problems with the remote controlling other items so I believe the problem to be with the type of reciever used in the Roku 2 XS.

For about 100 dollars and without any extra monthly payments, you will be able to enjoy tons of movies for free, even some important TV shows.The interface is relatively easy to use, but configuring channels require a PC. This is kind of annoying when you have to do that with several channels, wish you can do that directly with the console only, but once you passed that stage let's say there are no more extra steps or additional settings that you need to tweak.On the aesthetic side, is really small. The company also states it uses less power than previous model, but I honestly do not think that you will save thousands of dollars anyway; the biggest savings come from dropping your Cable TV service altogether.--The not so nice and what changed --Here's are the bad news. The firmware and software is buggy. I was watching Amazon on demand and the stuff restart twice. It happened several times and continue to happen, even after firmware upgrade. Something similar with Netflix. The \"supported\" channels take an eternity to load, like CNN. I understand that this device is basically a \"man in the middle\", just streaming the online content to your TV, but the previous model was much more stable (I sold it to get this one)But, If you are more into TV shows or live news, you are out of luck with Roku 2. Most of the unofficial channels do not work anymore: PlayOn, Plex, NokNok. Those basically allow  you to watch local USA TV or CBS on your TV, via Roku. They were working on the previous model, for some weird reason (copyright issues or software problems) they no longer work on this one and no ETA of when is going to be fixed, maybe never, who knows.So in a nutshell. You will loose the capability of watch those unofficial channels I mentioned, some ports were removed, the box is smaller and uses less power, and gives you a higher resolution for some movies or show. Worth the money? I don't think so. You can do exactly the same (with the exception of games and getting a higher resolution) with the Roku 1. Hence, I don't see a reason to upgrade or buy the new one.This is a nice product but it is too buggy or the company started to loss its battle against major TV stations.By the way, I currently have a 12Mbps Internet connection. Not a T1 or Fiber Optic, but more than enough to handle HD video streamingBuy the previous model instead and enjoy while it last ... it is a shame that USA users are condemned to pay higher bills if we want live TV and good programming...** EDIT ***8/16/2011Bought the previous model again, which I sold by mistake. Run the setup, added PlayOn, it works!!! Time to sell Roku 2.People, this is one of those cases where new does not mean better or faster. Just one more comment, we can still have or get 1024 dpi resolution on previous model. Also, most channels are not providing anything higher than 740, so even in resolution you're not going to lose anything if you buy the previous model instead.I would probably take a look on Roku 2 on 6 months or so, when it gets a more stable firmware and patches.For those interested: my PlayOn runs on a Mac mini 2010. The Mac Mini has 8GB of RAM and I assigned 2GB to the virtual machine. The virtual machine runs Windows XP SP3 and the virtualization software is Parallels. I tried Virtual box but does not provide the performance PLayOn needs."}, {"review_id": "24d4b0fe4dd85cc45b7492e7820d5dae", "review": "I have every electronic device currently available, now and in foreseeable distant future.

The box is small.  Seems to have more content to offer than competitors.Cons:1. No audio volume control.  Imagine you open some Amazon instant video and the volume is too loud, the only solution is to grab the other remote.  Notice this is not a cheap remote, which embeds some kind of motion sensor.  Some reviews defend this by saying something like no way to control the volume over hdmi or the box is not responsible for the audio, a joke.2. Sometimes when playing Amazon video the box would not response to the remote, which means you cannot pause or skip when you want to.  I gusss the bluetooth connection is lost.  Whatever the reason is, a bug.3. Must have a credit card to set up the box and account, in the name to make it easier for you to purchase something.  How come?4. No way to turn the box off.  To me, this means I have to use the other remote the turn my TV off.5. No support of youtube.  The unofficial one has been off the limits of new customers for half a year.  Maybe the new guys they hire need tons of time to read the source code.6. The user interface leaves a lot to improve.  When I was trying to input something in the search box, I would guess a remote with qwert keyboard or some convenient way to input characters will make the majority miserable.  By the way, if you have many channels, do not get tired when scrolling the main menu, as there is no way to sort out your channels.7.In short, this is not product designed for normal users.Buy a tv that supports netflix, Amazon video and youtube."}], "B005CLPP8E": [{"review_id": "e252ca313458d3b787a832a18af007d5", "review": "I previously bought a Google TV set before buying this.

My initial experience with the drives were good. They performed well and were quiet. However, within 9 months I had two failures. Both failures were immediate and showed no error conditions prior to their failure. Due to the RAID 5 configuration, I didn't experience data loss. Seagate replaced both drives without question, although I still had to cover shipping to send the failed drives to Seagate.Before my 2 TB drive failures, I purchased a Seagate 3 TB drive as part of an upgrade OWC did on my iMac. From the day the drive was installed, I had problems with OS and application stability. Within 9 months, the 3 TB Seagate drive had failed. I asked that OWC replace the failed Seagate drive with a Hitachi 2 TB drive. The iMac has been stable ever since.My conclusion from just my experience, is that Seagate drives have an unusually high failure rate when compared to the same number of Hitachi drives I've deployed. Seagate replaces failed drives without any pushback, but I'm uncomfortable placing critical data on the replacement drives. I end up deploying them into non-critical transient storage or as part of a layered backup strategy. To date, all of the replacement drives Seagate has sent me are performing well.Update: Two months after Seagate sent me a replacement for the 3 TB drive, the replacement has failed. The replacement drive is flagged as being out of warranty, even though the drive is only two months old. I don't expect that I will buy another Seagate product again."}], "B005DIBHA6": [{"review_id": "9ff59fd9b7df3d35fd085a333422984d", "review": "i have had a Zumo 550 for the motorcycle.

SharpKeys is a quick-and-easy solution for Windoze 2000/XP/7/8.  Make sure you download it from the author's website as the first two installers I downloaded (from sites I had considered trustworthy) were full of bloatware.  Once installed, I swapped the mapping of the up-arrow and right shift keys on my K400 and wow what a difference.  I'm actually pretty happy with this keyboard after this fix.  I would increase the rating to 4 stars, but the credit goes to randyrants_dot_com for the software, not Logitech.  The only downside with this fix is that it swaps the keys in the OS, so if you plug in another keyboard the up-arrow and right shift will be swapped on that too.  And if you VNC or Remote Desktop you will likely experience the same problem there.The only unfortunate thing with this finding is that there are so many reviews of this keyboard it's not likely that many existing owners will see this fix.Original Review:The K400 is a decent wireless keyboard.  The layout is pretty good given the small format.  The tactile feedback is good.  The battery life, so far, has been pretty good.  I've only had the keyboard for 2 months but just discovered the on/off switch, so I'm fairly impressed the battery has lasted this long (although it may also have an auto-off power save feature).  The range is just okay.  The spec indicates > 30', but my couch is just 10' from my PC in my media center and if I'm reclined or have my legs up a bit it tends to block the transmission.  If I have the media cabinet door closed the range is only a few feet at best.Despite these few short comings, this would be a nearly 5-star product save the one fatal flaw -- the location of the right shift key.  If you look at the right shift key on any well-used keyboard you'll generally see a shiny spot on the left side - where most people strike the key.  Logitech, a company which typically puts out some good, smart products, blew this one.  They put the up-arrow key in this location, making a skinny little shift key to the left of the up-arrow.  After two months of use I still up-arrow virtually every time I try to use the left shift key.  It drives me nuts and and is the reason for the 2-star review.  I have no earthly idea what they were thinking, I can only assume they never actually tested it."}, {"review_id": "27f3ae609a2ada363afca4011bbbe398", "review": "This thing ROCKS for the home theater PC ( HTPC )!

If there were one thing wrong with the touchpad, it might be that the sensitivity is just a hair low.The build quality is decent, but I wouldn't leave this thing out to get stepped on or dropped repeatedly. I just make sure to put it away when I am done. I have had no issue with the connectivity. I turn the keyboard on and have a connection in seconds. I typically work from 12ft away and have never missed a keystroke. I would buy and recommend this keyboard."}, {"review_id": "0950cea71f542efa865ec07e5a033165", "review": "The class is wireless RF keyboards with touchpads, which have media keys, and are relatively compact, yet usable for extended typing, and which are not prohibitively expensive. It's a surprisingly limited class, given current trends in home theaters and media consumption. I've listed another contender, below.First, note that I have the white K400R. The R indicates the updated keyboard, with some reprogrammable features, and which has volume controls on the F10-F12 keys. The older K400 has volume controls on the hotkey buttons, above. At this writing, Amazon offers either black or white versions of the keyboard, BUT, the black one is the K400, and the white one is the K400R.The keyboard layout is not full-sized. It's just a bit larger than the one on my Asus EeePC netbook. I have no problem with this size, though some users may find it too small. Some have complained about the stretch required to get to the right shift key. While it IS a stretch, the smaller overall size of the keyboard makes the stretch not as bad as it may appear. Keystroke feel is pretty good. Build quality is pretty good. You get some minor creaks when picking it up in various ways, but, picking it up with one hand -- thumb under the touchpad -- is solid enough.For me, a keyboard that lacks dedicated Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys is a non-starter. For that reason, I had always avoided the K400. I decided to give the K400R a try, when I learned that it is \"programmable.\" Well, it is sort of programmable: 3 hotkey buttons (media player, PC lock, PC sleep) and 6 function keys (F1-F6) can be reconfigured with Logitech's downloadable Setpoint software. Note that the Home button can NOT be reassigned.I set up the F1 and F2 keys as Page Up and Page Down. The F3 and F4 keys became Home and End. To help identify their function, I put thin strips of colored electrical tape on the button risers (I'll try to add a photo). [Unfortunately, these new navigation keys do not work with the control or shift key, such as when selecting text.] I set F5 to be WMC toggle between full-screen and window mode. F6 is set to be quick skip (aka skip ahead, aka ad skip).When Googling for keystrokes necessary to program F5 and F6, I discovered two things about Windows Media Center. 1) There are keyboard shortcuts available for all operations we might want to accomplish with dedicated media keys. Nice. You could actually live without a \"media keyboard,\" if you don't mind using the control- and alt- shifted keystrokes. 2) The quick skip interval can be modified with the skipaheadinterval registry setting (exercise caution; and, Google for full instructions). Instead of the default 30 seconds, skipping ads in recorded programs might be easier if set to skip 60 seconds, or even 3 minutes.The next issue some people have expressed with this keyboard is that the FN key must be pressed to get regular F1-F12 keystokes, since the media and windows functions have been set for non-FN priority. Fortunately, this can be reversed in Setpoint. BTW, Setpoint may not immediately offer configuration options on new setups. It seems you must first use the software to unpair and then re-establish connection (using another keyboard or mouse), before all options are shown.In spite of my tendency to frequently use the F5 and F11 keys, I decided to maintain priority for the media keys. To avoid having to FN shift for F5 and F11, I set the PC lock and PC sleep buttons to provide those functions.The touchpad has a good feel for general use and 2-finger scroll. Pinch-zoom works, but, I've never had that before, so can't compare feel.There are 2 significant problems with the touchpad, which I have decided to live with. They are known issues, as they have appeared in problem reports on the Logitech support forum. 1) The 2-finger right-click often does not work. It appears to vary depending on window focus, or use of 2-finger scroll. It's so bad, I'd rather use my thumb on the right mouse button, below the touchpad. 2) While double-tap-drag does work for some things, like moving a window by the title bar, it does NOT work to resize a window. Resizing becomes a 2-hand operation, though the left mouse button on the top left corner makes it less awkward than if using the touchpad's left button.Some users might find happiness with the Ortek WKB-2000, currently listed on Amazon as \"2.4GHz RF Wireless Keyboard with Smart Touchpad Mouse for MCE Media Center Edition\". I could not get the 2-finger scroll to work. From reading reviews, and through my own efforts, I discovered there is no good driver for Windows 7, 64-bit.The best keyboard I've had is listed on Amazon as \"RK728 Wireless Keyboard\". Mine just died, and it was a great loss! Unfortunately, it is not currently available, even on the 'bay. That may be because of quality control problems. I knew mine would not last forever, and had tried twice to buy a backup. But, both failed in a few days, and were returned.Also noteworthy, is the Adesso WKB-4000UB. It has a great form factor, good key action, and is currently available, but, it has no media keys. Worse than that, the touchpad seems to be pretty low resolution, and, about half the time, tap to click does not register, so, I have to move the pointer slightly, and tap again. For that reason, I just use it as a backup. Mine is several years old, so, it is possible that the touchpad has been improved. Oh, and the touchpad has a scroll zone on the right edge, rather than 2-finger scroll.3 1/2 stars would be the best rating for the K400R."}, {"review_id": "c44118d149d67037c9085dd4e604b27b", "review": "Sure laptops are great, but what if it's out of reach or requires you to sit up to get it?

The only limitation I've found is that playlists can only be stored on the internal memory.What I really like though is that I can select MP3 folders from the external memory card and then select shuffle at any level. So I can shuffle the entire card, a folder for one artist, one genre, etc. Or I can select one album and play or shuffle that. It nearly eliminates the need for playlists which is great since the internal memory is somewhat limited.Sound is good in the car and with earbuds. For music and other audio content this little device is a great value."}, {"review_id": "6b96927316060c1b1b85d04cbe71d6f3", "review": "I love everything about these players except for 2 things.

Not the internal memory of this player. Even with 8 GB, I can't always record the 3 day program without having to have a PC with me to move the data to open up memory space.

The description provided by Amazon, the seller, was rather lack-luster.  Here is my summary of my thoughts-and-impression.1) Ordered Oct 22, arrived Oct 242) Ordered four (4), got four3) Arrived in a rather big box with contents flopping though no visible damage - combined with another order4) Flash Drive includes unmentioned SanDisk SecureAccess software (AES-128bit) that is a little out-of-date.  Should be at least AES-256bit and should use FAT32 at a minimum with NTFS preferred. It is a USB2 device.5) Testing flash drive (Win):a) root directory has two visible folders (club-application and SanDiskSecureAccess)b) root directory has two executable files (RunClubSanDisk.exe and RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exe)c) root directory has a hidden file autorun.inf (can be opened with Notepad if curious)d) flash drive packaging indicates WinXP, Vista, and 7 are supported as well as Mac OS X v10.5+e) Mac users needing security are directed to the SanDisk website's SecureAccess page (URL will be censored by Amazon) for downloadf) The club application was of absolutely no interest and the associated folders/files were deleted.  It is one of those, \"Get special offers from SanDisk partners\" RPIA's.g) The SanDisk SecureAccess Quick Start Guide is a PDF located in the SanDiskSecureAccess folder.  If the SanDisk SecureAccess process is something that has never been used, this provided guide would be a must to read - it is short.h) If I recall, correctly, the, unwritten, MAXIMUM, vault size is 4gb which is sufficiently large to hold the contents of one (1) DVD.  If compressed (ZIP'd) files are written to the flash drive, it is often possible to squeeze more than 4gb of uncompressed files into the 4gb vault space; however, this is way to subjective to give any \"reasonable\" percentage since compression depends upon the compression software and the file content being compressed (e.g. video, text, spreadsheet, document, database, etc.).i) Normally, I delete all of these provided tools.  If I change my mind at some future date, I can go to the SanDisk website and download the SecureAccess software. (If there is the curious streak, the older U3 software is also available that is more userfriendly and more out-of-date and does NOT use the \"vault\" concept.  Get both the install and the uninstall software if you think about using it.  BTW, you are, of course on your own though the support folks will sometimes answer questions.)j) If you do use the provided tools, do MAKE SURE the Closing your private vault instructions, on page 8 (English) are followed.  The flash like any plug-and-play device will mostly always be unaffected by just yanking from the USB port; however, the more important the information stored, the greater the chance the once-in-a-million \"oops\" corruption will strike.k) There is a place on the drive to attach a lanyard, or string, to keep loss at a minimum.  I am thinking the cap is a gonner since it does not fit all that securely; however, this comment in no way obviates the intended purpose of the device and how it works.  Just doNOT use peanut butter as a place to stick the drive to keep it from getting lost (you are going to have to figure out the reasoning for this comment).l) Did they work?It was curious that the thumbnail icon for the flash drives was that for the ClubSanDisk and not the SanDisk SecureAccess when it appeared.  It seemed to have a great deal of difficulty in displaying after the longer than expected recognition and driver-installation.  Specificially, the autorun.inf was configured for the ClubSanDisk.I changed my autorun.inf to the following (if you choose to do so, YOU do it at your own \"RISK!\"):[autorun]action=SecureAccessopen=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeicon=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeWhat does this mean if the icon does not show?  Well, you may have to \"guess\" which drive letter is associated with your flash drive - no biggie; but, rather annoying.  For some reason, I got noticably slower access and usage, \"IF\" I had a USB3 device plugged into one of the available USB2 ports at the same time.m) Getting the little drive out of the packaging was an interesting exercise in frustration.  The first one I could extract \"almost\" using the cut line indicated on the packaging.  The second one required a little more effort since the cap was stuck to the packaging which required major surgery to get the clear plastic unstuck from the cap.  The third flash was a little easier to extract from the packaging though the cap did provide a moment!  The fourth drive packaging was cut on the bottom end and this seemed to allow easier extraction of the drive and the cap.  Also, then) Insertion and removal from a powered USB hub; and, the same for other USB ports was reasonably effortless due to the lanyard connector that offered a place to get a grip.o) The flash drive device is not realy designed, in my opinion, for a lot of insertions and removals from a USB port.  I always connect these \"cheap\" devices to a powered-USB port so any damage done by the device's connector only affects the easily replaced hub and does not damage my computer.Close, click \"eject\" ... and ... REMEMBER, it is better to be safe than be the \"did it to yourself\" victim because the \"Safely Remove Hardware\" icon in your tray was not used!

Store it for fun things like music, photos, video clip, or things you want to share with others. Buy the 8GB or 16GB version so you don't have to stored too many things in one place. If you needed a bigger space, get a portable hard drive. Flash drive isn't meant for large storage due to the slow speed. You wouldn't want to upload HD contents because it will take you longer then you would expect. If you want it for storing songs for your car, the smaller the size the better. Reason is your stereo play have limitation to number of folder and size. It make no sense have large space when you're stereo cannot handle it. Small files will do nicely on this kind of drive.Reasons you shouldn't buy it. If you're planning on storing sensitive data, I highly recommend you to look for something that's hard to lose or have a very strong attachment to your keys or other belongings you often carry with you.

It must also do so reliably for a period of years, but at this early stage I cannot vouch for that. Ease of installation is also essential; a mass storage device should be completely plug-and-play; and it is helpful for it to be preformatted--this one is formatted NTFS for Windows XP and above. These are all the qualities that I want in such a device, but this drive also provides a couple of bonuses: portability and backup software. Although I use the drive with a desktop, portability, i.e. small size and ability to be powered from a USB port, are nice to have anywhere; not having to have an extra cable with a transformer plug that takes up a lot of space on a power strip is a convenience to cheer.As to reliability over a period of years, I have only had my new drive for a week, so I cannot speak to that; however, I will try to make it a point to update this review should the drive fail prematurely (I expect about a five-year lifespan--knock on wood). Thus far, I have written 340 GB of data to it; and from it I have played back HD video (full-frame-rate, full-HD mpeg-type, not just Flash) without a hitch or a glitchAmong these reviews I noticed a lot of complaints about the backup software. They may very well true; and this is not to excuse WD; but I have to say that I have never met a backup program that I liked. Most, including some top-rated, have vital functions that simply don't work. I currently use Windows 7's own backup program; it isn't great--not much flexibility and control; but it's free, and it works (so far).My main motivation for writing this review is to try to provide a little help with installation, which should reassure prospective buyers disturbed by the experiences reported by some other customers. I said above that installing mass storage should be a simple matter of plugging it in, and under the right conditions that is all that this drive requires. But \"under the right conditions\" can be a big \"if\"; and a variety of issues can plague the installation of this drive as a USB 3.0 device. In my case, I had never attached a USB 3.0 device to my system before; and I found that Windows would not recognize the device when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. As a search on \"WD Passport USB 3.0 Installation Problems\" reveals, there are several problems that can occur; and dealing with all those is not the purpose of this review; however, I simply want to do two things: (1) reassure you that this device does in fact come with a good USB 3.0 cable, and that it transfers data at a considerably higher speed over USB 3 as compared with USB 2; and (2) to warn the buyer that (s)he may require a driver update for his/her PC. Regarding the first point, I am getting better than 2.5 times the data transfer rate with USB 3.0 versus USB 2. Regarding the second, the updated driver required will most likely be the one associated with the USB hardware on the motherboard of your PC; if you have problems using your WD passport on a USB 3 port, but not on a USB 2 port, visit either your PC vendor's website, or that of the maker of the motherboard, and do a search on USB 3 drivers. WD also provides firmware updates for its drives; but in my case at least, the Passport's firmware was already up to date as received.While I am in the business of giving tips related to the purchase of an external HD, be aware that if you want a hassle-free installation you might want to avoid drives with over 2TB of capacity. I, and others, have had issues, especially with Windows Backup, with 3TB drives. It turns out that the solution is fairly simple: use the WD Quick Formatter tool (available on WD's website) *before* attempting to use the drive (reformatting will wipe out any data you've already put there). As long as you're willing to take that extra step, it's fine to get a 3TB drive; and I have had no further problems with a 3TB drive. To be clear, the drive I am reviewing here is a 2TB drive; but I just thought I'd throw in this extra tip for people who are reading these reviews and are still undecided about what size to get."}, {"review_id": "b9187f0ade3a1c45d6c47cec66345023", "review": "///Update: 26Oct2012///After some Googling, I found that it is a common issue with WD that you cannot view two or more HD's plugged in. There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive \"online\". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently. I have used mine for some time now and through my travels overseas and it is still going strong even with the climate changes (extreme hot in the desert and snowing winter).Bottom line, a must have item for large media files during any time of travels due to its capacity, portability, and size. Just don't expect to be able to plug two at one time to your laptop and see both of them."}, {"review_id": "e3d88b6e4646cd3ab1b700e9db1b5ad6", "review": "Works great, easy to use, small, lightweight.

I bought 3 of these drives mainly because I was getting tired of using external hard drives that required their own power supply, and like the idea of a portable, USB powered backup.I've had WD drives before and not experienced any issues with them (I've got a couple of their 'powered' drives).  But these little buggers have been frustrating!ALL 3 WORK independently.  No issues there.  The trouble begins when you try to daisy chain and use more than one at a time!  A single 2TB drive was not going to be enough, so the plan was to link these together using a powered hub.My system:  HP 19\" laptop, running windows 7, 64 bit.  4 GB RAMHow I prepared and set up the drives:1 - The drives are ready to go out of the box.  The cables that come with them are PATHETICALLY SHORT.  About a foot long.2 - For each drive, I plugged them in one at a time and went into the properties to give them a unique drive name as to not confuse the computer, and keep them straight in windows explorer.  To keep it easy, I named them \"My Passport 1\", \"My Passport 2\", and \"My Passport 3\".  (I get the same problem I am about to describe if I have spaces in the name, or not)3 - To link them together, I made use of the following:a - HDE 2 Port USB 3.0 54mm Express CardB0046XUMDWb - Anker USB 3.0 7-Port Hub with 36W Power AdapterB006TT91TWc - AmazonBasics USB 3.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension CableB008EQYRRY4 - I tested the cable (3c Above) first by plugging each drive into the female end, and the male end into the express card (3a above).  the drive spun up, computer recognized it with no issues.  All 3 drives checked out OK.5 - I then tested the powered hub (3b above).  Plugged it into the Express Card (3a above) directly, the other end into an outlet.  I plugged in each drive one at a time (tested individually)... no issues.  all drives recognized.6 - next, I tested the hub WITH the cable.  I plugged the cable (3c) into the express card (3a), then the Hub (3b) into the cable (3c), AC adapter into the outlet.  The PC recognized the hub with no issues.This is where it gets puzzling:7 - I plugged \"My Passport 1\" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 1\" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.8 - I plugged \"My Passport 2\" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 2\" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.9 - I plugged \"My Passport 3\" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, AND THAT WAS IT.  windows explorer would not see the 3rd drive, yet the computer must, because you get the audio tone as you did with the first 2.  I clicked on the properties for the drivers; on 'manage'; checked in 'device manager' - no way on earth to get to the 3rd drive.  yet you can pick it up and feel it is running.I installed the software that came with the hub, rebooted after installing each drive, nothing seems to work.10 - I ruled out a bad drive by repeating the procedures above, but changing the order of the drives being connected to the hub.  I started with 'my passport 3' - fired up, recognized no problems (yet in #9 - the computer would see it based on the sound, but that was it).  plugged in 'my passport 1'.  it also fired up, computer recognized - windows explorer opened - good to go.  plugged 'my passport 2' into the hub, behavior was similar to #9.things I have not tried yet:  2 drives in the Express card and one drive into the onboard USB2 port, but what sense would THAT make?  all 3 USB 3.0 drives will boot individually with the hub, but no more than 2 of them.ANYONE else had this problem or have a solution?  you should be able to plug all 3 drives into the 7 port hub with no issues.  I can plug 2 drives into the hub, and then plug an older USB 2.0 drive into the hub, 2 thumbnail drives - all work in harmony.  but 3 WD 2TB drives?  haven't figured that one out yet"}, {"review_id": "ea210b0c069ce9b3f02af3a0a1290350", "review": "Finally we have a sizable amount of storage (2TB) in a compact shell.

Unlike the 3.5\" hard drive world, capacities are larger earlier in the external devices, but somehow the casing and enclosed bridge (in this case SATA to USB) make the physical size larger than an internal drive with case.  This one is still a little bigger, but really quite small.  It's awesome, frankly.  To have that much capacity in something you can store just about anywhere and you don't even have to mess around with a power cord.What I don't like - and I complain about this with all external hard drives - is the included software that they want you to install to do backups, etc.  As an advanced computer user, I think it's nonsense; even my mother should be able to use the drive without any software.

The thing that annoys me is that the drive - again, like all other externals nowadays - comes with a sleep timer set, in this case at 30 minutes, so I have to install the interface software to turn that off (necessary for my intended application), and then uninstall the software to get it off my system, but all software leaves a trace after its removal.If this is your first USB 3.0 peripheral, be aware that the port on the drive is unlike any USB 2.0 port, and thus will require a different cable if you need one longer than the included ~1m cable.  More industry stupidity, so they can overcharge for the first year or so.  Look for a cheap one on Amazon so you don't have to run out to Best Buy and pay 10x too much.  Interface cables are the one thing I believe in buying as cheap as possible - and thank God for Amazon in that respect.One more note in response to another review:  prices on non-solid state hard drives have been fluctuating a lot recently because of the Thai floods, and prices of electronics on Amazon always fluctuate.  I typically check all prices before buying anything, but still end up buying from Amazon 99% of the time.  I haven't seen Best Buy have a real deal in years.  They make their money off lies that their employees tell you, either because they have been brainwashed in to believing said lies or because of commission.  Do your own price comparison when the time comes to make a purchase.The only thing I don't love about this drive is an industry problem that's not going away any time soon, and I have to just stop complaining about it (later).  I give this a higher than average review because I was actually surprised - and impressed - with the physical size."}, {"review_id": "48d4316dd27edc837ae1f662200b451f", "review": "this drive is excellent.

The one complaint I have above in the cons is that it can be difficult to open up the case because the iPad tends to flip backwards instead of the whole top flipping back. My recommendation would be to find some sort of locking mechanism that would keep it locked to the arm until the user wanted to unclip it.

I received this product and right off the bat I liked the packaging and the helpful instructions inside.  After having a chance to use It I was blown away.  It has sturdy construction and the battery life on the keyboard is very nice.  Not to mention rechargeable.  In other products you would have to lug around a keyboard and a case if you wanted something to protect your device and be able to be productive.  With this case it is all in one.  I liked the adjustability of the orientations that the pad could be put in it helps when doing different tasks.  I also liked the adjustability because there are sometimes depending on light and other factors when you need the Ipad to be at a certain angle.I have in the past had a case that did well with protecting it, and had a stand but it was two pieces and the stand was not very adjustable.  I would have to use other small items to prop the screen up further.I also believe this case provides decent protection to my device, although I am not sure I would want to drop it in this case as I think the case would not fully protect it.  But for every day usage I believe that it would hold up.I like the look and feel of the keyboard the layout is nice and they keys are great to type with.  I do not do a lot of writing on my pad but with some of the new apps coming out for the pad I just may start on my memoirs.  Syncing the pad to the keyboard was quick and easy and worked right out of the box with no charging required.  The response of the keys are very fast and I do not even notice the time it take over Bluetooth.New Trent also took care to make sure all of the proper ports were left unobstructed. I even find that most aftermarket cables for the ipad function with this case on.  The one thing I would like to see, and I am not sure if it is even possible would be a all in one usb cord.  One that could connect to a apple charger and into a single usb port instead of having to find two separate ports to use for charging and using the pad.  I do admit that this would be a rare thing but I think it would put this product over the top.I think this product would be great for business men and women, a suitable replacement for a cumbersome laptop or when you just need something small for traveling.  It is a little hard to fit most modern day laptops on a seatback not to mention they are very heavy.  With this product you get a mini laptop just for the cost of your already purchased ipad and less than $40.00.I have enjoyed all the New Trent products to date and I can not wait to see what the good people in this company come up with next."}, {"review_id": "4126db393c38a113611ac6032aaa9704", "review": "Been looking for a keyboard for my ipad for a while and happened upon this. I've had good luck with New Trent's stuff so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really like the fact that it doubles as a case (hence the clamshell) when closed up. The Blutooth keyboard pairs in a snap and works great. Love the added function keys (home button, etc.) and found the size more than comfortable to type on. I've had this on my ipad for a while. I thought this would be one of those things I'd use solely for travel but the truth is this case/keyboard has stayed on my iPad since I bought it. The matte finish is nice and I love that it's not emblazoned with stupid logos.  Doesn't add a lot of weight and I really like the adjustability of the screen angle. Battery life is pretty terrific, too. One other nice thing - I like being able to 'detach' the iPad and set that up as a separate piece from the keyboard. There are some other nice touches - the rubber feet, the fact that you can change from portrait to landscape. Once you remove the iPad from the arm, the hard plastic case stays with it so conceivably you could just travel with that. It's not perfect - I realized carrying it in my bag that it is just a little heavier than I would like. And it would be nice if the hinge had a ratchet action. But overall this is a really nice set up, and I've had experience with a number of these types of keyboards. All in all, I'm really happy with it."}, {"review_id": "c90a80e7e172adfa392a551a1711cdda", "review": "The airbendar case is an excellent accessory for the ipad. I am using it with an ipad 2. I purchased it after I was happy with two other iPad keyboard purchases. The Airbender is lime having three accessories in one. First it functions as a keyboard, second as a case; and third as a stand. The nearly unlimited amount of positions the keyboard/case can be configured is awesome. The entire Keyboard can be separated from the iPad half of the case which is perfect for users that desire a little more distance between the two. The iPad can be used independent of the keyboard while still retaining half the case to protect the bottom and sides. It uses a pinch lock mechanism to quickly unsnap it. Other keyboard case solution areMuch more tedious. The keyboard has worked flawlessly since purchase. It was extremely easy to pair with the iPad. Feedback on the keys is excellent. Much better than those keyboards with the soft rubbery feel. The keyboard is also larger then most iPad keyboard which makes using it much, much easier for people like me with large hands. I charged the case once and 8 days later and its still working off the initial charge. I have no doubt that it will stay charged for weeks or months. Another great feature is the Airbender functions as a stand and can be configured in portrait mode for typing documents or landscape mode for games and movies. The case also shuts off the iPad when closed with the magnetic switch. The case looks great open or closed. I brought it to work and had several people asking me about it and where I got it. It has a very cool functional design. The iPad is held securely in place and all ports and switches are easy accessible. I highly recommend this keyboard/case combination."}, {"review_id": "623cec49e7b276eb75f7f5ca5b1c6bdf", "review": "I really don't have anything new to report after reading many of the reviews, I just wanted to add my comments.I purchased the Airbender keyboard and case to compare it to the Logitech aluminum case. WIth the latter, I used the keyboard infrequently however every time that I went to use it, I took a considerable number errors and miskeys until I got into the swing of it. My opinion is that the keys are just to close together on the keyboard and hence I regularly ended up pushing both adjacent keys.Enter the Airbender. The first thing I notice, and looked for, was a tad of spacing between the keys and was pleased to see it. This is achieved I feel by reducing the size of the keys from 16mm on the Logitech to 14mm on the Airbender. Hence there is, in my opinion,  just enough space to allow me to type without constant errors. I did find that the right shift key was a little awkwardly spaced to the right of the \"page up\" key and it is a little small, however with time I am sure I will get used to it.As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the clamshell mechanism is a little fiddly to get it situated however, when it is finally set up, bingo! I especially like the way it can be either landscape or portrait or anything in-between if you so desire unlike other clamshells on the market. The ability to be able to detach the iPad quickly from the keyboard is ingenious and useful although I did, again, find it a little fiddly re-attaching however I am sure practice will make perfect. Compared to the Logictech which, when the iPad is stowed away, is very sleek and has a nice look due to the aluminum case, the Airbender is a little more bulky however the practicality of the product outweighs the negative of this feature.I think I read that it was not possible to charge the iPad while the case is closed however mine seems to be able to do this without a problem. I also read that the auto off function using, I presume, magnets was spotty and I have to say I have also found this. That being said, I usually manually switch off my iPad and keyboard prior to closing the case so it is not an issue. In the case that I do forget, hopefully the timer auto off will work however I am not sure if this will happen if the case is linked with the bluetooth keyboard. Either way, this is certainly not a big issue in my mind.All in all, I think this is a well designed and thought out case. It is exactly what I needed and , although bulkier than the Logictech, I am very pleased I purchased it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants the benefit of a true keyboard as opposed to the screen keyboard."}, {"review_id": "22c742eebd8eb64a4b162f06ae781933", "review": "-Love this product!  I have tried other wireless keyboards, but usually I opt out to scrapping the keyboard and just use the case by itself, but the Airbender Case/keyboard is definitely a keeper.1) It is functional and easy to use as a case and a keyboard.  Functionally from a keyboard perspective I had no issue with sync'ing it up via bluetooth to my Ipad.  Overall the keyboard is responsive, I have not had an issue yet with it either dropping or disconnecting or not recognizing my key strokes.2) Keyboard is nice, keys have a nice heft and snap to it so it feels responsive, almost like a normal keyboard.  Size is nice as well and has the basic keys you would want on a keyboard with other hotkey functions that I like, not having to go through the apple menu options to access (brightness, sound, pictures, internet, etc.)3) Keyboard attached to the Ipad is versatile and works well together, allows for multiple orientations and tilts, one thing it does not do is allow you to extend the ipad away from the keyboard.  Another thing I noticed was If you use the tilt with the whole arm it works fine, but if you try to tilt the screen without moving the arm, it will move back to rest on the arm, not a big deal but an observation I had.  Another thing that I noticed was that sometimes if you had the case open, the weight of the Ipad could tilt the entire case backwards.4) The case itself combined with the keyboard is solid, i have no problem carrying the whole thing around, it does add weight, but what do you expect with an additional keyboard.  I would like to have had the surfaces with more of a rubbery or raised feel so it is easier to grip.  It does allow you to separate the case from the keyboard, but only offers back protection when separate.Overall the case as a whole is great, I do not think I will use just a normal case without the keyboard, this provides so much more function to the overall product.  I no longer an weary of writing long emails on my Ipad now that I have the keyboard to match.  It also provides the needed support and protection to keep your Ipad running for a long, long time!  5***** I would definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "94fd45a85d92053e2c09ebeef1b1fbb0", "review": "Upon first opening the box I was impressed at the overall look of the case.  It is very slim but at the same time very sturdy case.  The ipad clipped right on and the keyboard connected right away with the bluetooth.  I have only been using the case for about a week now but have very few issues.  The keyboard works great and looks good enough that people don't believe it's not a laptop until I show them.The keyboard itself is fairly light and I carry around my iPad almost full time with the keyboard and use it like my old netbook.  The keys work great and the only issue I've had is due to limited space the right shift key is smaller to make room for the up arrow.  I find myself hitting the up arrow a lot when going for the shift but it is something minor that with continued use is becoming less and less.  The battery life is also great.  I charged the keyboard the recommended 6 hours when I got it and I have not had to charge it yet (5 days as I use it to write this).The mount for the iPad itself is pretty simple and connect by simply squeezing together the tabs.  The biggest issue I have with the mount is the option to slide it in and out.  You have to slide the lock to move it out (move iPad away from you) but it slides in without the lock.  If you have it out and push or move the keyboard it has a tendency to move all the way back in.  Tilting back and forth is semi difficult also but that may be it is fairly new and will loosen up a bit with continued use.My only other con is a personal preference due to the fact I'm a pilot and use the iPad in the cockpit so it may not apply to you.  When I take the iPad off the keyboard before the flight I now have to find a place to safely store the keyboard.  It is rugged but I don't want to just throw it in my flight back and have items pressing on the keys.I have not tried it yet but it does appear the top case is actually thin enough to fit into other cases to be used as a pilot kneeboard.Overall I am very satisfied with this case.  I don't think you will find another hard case or keyboard combo that will compete with the NT38B anywhere near the price range.  I highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "a1132f7be59965e400b5ba1e33398059", "review": "This is my second iPad case, I also have a travel case that has no keyboard.

If you look in the product photos,you'll see the iPad part connects on a swivel through what is essentially a camera lens cap.  That part is ok and secure,except the camera lens cap part is on a very loose hinge itself.  The main hinge, however, is very stiff.  So, you have to use a fair amount of force to open the case.  Once you get it about 30 degrees or so open, you have to switch your grip.  If you don't, the weak camera lens cap hinge comes into play,and all the force you were putting on the stiff main hinge moves to the no resistance camera lens cap hinge.  More than a few times it would suddenly flip open on me, causing me to nearly drop my iPad.  Not cool.  I also started to experience some other issues, like the keyboard was doubling some letters--like the letter &#34;E&#34;. Talk about the worst letter to double every 4/5 times you type it...Another issue is adjusting the view angle.  The iPad holder part has a ratcheting mechanism that locks the screen at a set distance from the keyboard.  Problem is, it ratchets going out.  Which means any time you what to adjust the angle, the ratchet part offers no resistance and the screen just slides right over the top of the keyboard.  Any adjustments become two handed, one to mess with the stiff hinge and screen angle, the other to make sure the screen stays at the right distance from the keyboard.Finally, the charge light went on and stayed on.  To me, this was indicative of some serious quality issues, and I wasn't going to hang around and see what failed next."}, {"review_id": "02dc9798e38f165443627576b7151248", "review": "I am typing this review on the NT38B and will be comparing this to two other keyboards I have used with my iPad - a Logitech Ultrathin KB cover and the Zaggkeys Pro.  Somewhat unfair because both of these items are far more expensive.What I like about the NT38B:The versatility of the cover - being able to orient the iPad in many different configurations.  This is especially helpful when in the field or on transport (i.e. planes and subways)Pairing was simple but for some reason took longer than my other keyboards.The thinness of the unit - it fits in my charger unit without my having to remove the iPad - this is a big plusWeight is nice and light but the tradeoff is that the keyboard is a little flimsy and bends a bit on uneven or soft surfaces (like my lap!)Positive closure on the unit - the Logitech drove me crazy as the unit would not stay closed and almost caused a nasty accident which prompted me to not use it again.Secure footing - many units topple backwards with the iPad in portrait mode - not the NT38B - it is steady as a rockKeyboard - good assortment of command keys and great layout.  The size of keys are good but for my liking, they could be a little smaller but with the same spacing so there is a little more room between each key - this helps with the speed of my typing as I tend to trip over neighboring keys.  The action is pretty good for an inexpensive keyboard but still cannot compare with the Zagg which I think has the best action in the business.  Still, the issues I have had with other cheap keyboards did not appear with the NT38B - things such as stuck keys or repeating keyssssssss, etc.  There does seem to be a slight lag at times but I am a fast typist.  Still, not an issue with the Logitech or the ZaggThis next item is picayune but I miss the lit keyboard I have with my Zagg.  I would be willing to pay $15 more to have that option.Overall, this is the best inexpensive keyboard/case for an iPad that I have used."}, {"review_id": "619cba4ca9e7f893d4d65eec087da2a8", "review": "I recieved the airbender bluetooth keyboard and have some pros and cons about it.ProsThe airbender case is very comfortable. It controls the iPad very well with its dedicated macro buttons.Being able to swivel the iPad is very useful in situations where you'd like to type in portrait mode. Being able to disconnect the iPad from the keyboard is very useful and the case has proven to be very helpful. Don't trust it to protect it from a drop but it certainly is better than nothing. And the overall battery life is very good. I didn't find myself charging it too often honestly, which shocked me.ConThe Preview photo button seems to have absolutely no use. It will unlock the iPad but doesn't open anything and while the iPad is unlocked it does nothing. It just seems redundant as there is an unlock button already.The page up and down buttons don't seem to work in safari, nor any other browser I've tried. There might be other apps where they work but I haven't found them yet. Disconnecting the iPad from the keyboard isn't as easy as I was hoping it would be. As awesome as the concept is there needs to be better grips to take the iPad off.Opening the keyboard with the iPad is a pain. As you try and open it the iPad practically slips over the keys and flings out. The iPad swings a little too freely and doesn't exactly support the weight of it too well.All in all the airbender keyboard is awesome and is worth the money.

Aesthetically speaking, it's nice enough, with a slate-colored matte finish and a smooth feel that is not polished or slick, so that it will not inadvertently escape your grasp.I generally don't like any case (with or without a keyboard) that is intended to be used essentially as a permanent home for the ipad because the form factor and tactile experience of a naked ipad is so nice and enjoyable that it usually cheapens the experience when it's in a protective case. (For instance, the Otterbox cases cases certainly offer good protection, but it's such a chore to get the ipad secured into it in the first place that you never want to take it out --- so i actually got rid of my eexpensive Otterbox case.) The ipad snaps very easily and quickly in and out of place in the Airbender case, however. Even better, you can simply detach the iPad enclosure from the keyboard portion of the case and hold the iPad normally. This makes it easy to envision using the case on days when one is going to do a lot of typing, such as note-taking in meetings, but popping the case off when you want to sit with the ipad on your lap in the evening for some casual web browsing, facebook, or watching a movie, etc.Overall, I find this to be a nice product that is very competitively priced.PROS:- The keyboard responds well, connection via bluetooth is easy and fast, the battery life is on par with other similar products, and the fact that it allows for rotating the iPad to portrait mode is a nice plus.- It's great that you can utilize this case in so many different positions, with the iPad and keyboard each attached or detached, in portrait or landscape mode, etc.- Lightweight, and does not add a lot of additional bulk to the iPad.CONS:- My biggest complaint with this case is that I found the placement of the \"lock\" button on the small keyboard, just above the \"delete\" button to be a bit of a flaw. Far too often, when I tried to correct a misspelled word by using the delete button I mistakenly hit the lock button, and then had to stop typing, and unlock the ipad using the slider on the screen.

Mostly because I know when an accessory contains a battery, it should be brought up to full charge first. The User Guide is simple, easy to understand and use. Pairing the keyboard to the iPad bluetooth was straightforward and the connection is persistent when the case and iPad are separated and reunited.The feel of the keyboard is nice and even with my large hands the key size feels comfortable. The case is surprisingly light for its seemingly durable construction. Only time can test the actual durability but I have no initial concerns about this. The magnetic auto shutoff works great but you have to remember to keep the landscape orientation in the right direction. I rotated the case so that the charging cable could feed from the other direction and simply closed the case after use. I was surprised when I reopened the case and the battery was almost completely discharged. It took me a little while to realize what I had done. Easy lesson learned.I like the adjustability of the stand support but sometimes when it is in the case, it takes a little tweaking of the positions to get the iPad to sit solidly. A small price to pay for the flexibility of position choices. Bottom line, I bought this case for the keyboard, and to my surprise I received a light, durable case that gave me an incredible number of choices for positioning my iPad, even free standing. In this dimension AirBender surpassed my Pong Research case with its \"Origami\" design which I have found to be unstable in many of its orientations."}, {"review_id": "96e4596a391240662432593dd883f68f", "review": "Initial thoughts: The v1.0 of the Airbender while a capable case, lacks some of the features of its v2.0 counterpart.  Namely a rubberized/anti-slip external surface and a more complete structure for surrounding the iPad, including a screen protector.  However, in a closed position, the iPad is enclosed in the case.A major feature which I&#8217;ve found lacking in other manufacturer&#8217;s options is the full keyboard with two shift keys.  For anyone who has any typing skills, a singular shift key will frustrate you after a very short time.The Airbender v1.0 like v2.0 has the ability to tilt the screen at various angles.  One feature that is present in v1.0 and not in v2.0 is the very pronounced groves to rest the iPad in while fully opened.  There are two groves that can accommodate various viewing angles.Additionally the iPad can be rotated between landscape and portrait to accommodate varied applications.The LED&#8217;s for CAPS, CHRG and BT are very bright and serve their purpose well.  By comparison, other cases I&#8217;ve used have very dim LEDs making it very difficult to see if one is illuminated.Final thoughts: I give the Airbender v1.0 a rating of 4/5.  While lacking a few features, the Airbender v1.0 is still a nice case and has features that excel when compared with some of its competitors many of which cost more.  With the rotatable screen, various viewing angles and the full keyboard, this case is quite functional."}, {"review_id": "aec6629d9f380ef62c84ff63325a6877", "review": "1.

The fact that the Airbender can be used as two separate pieces is great. If I just want to play, I can use it as a stand with the keypad detached.  It was easy to set up the Bluetooth and easy to use. I would highly recommend this accessory for everyone.

There truly are very few real competitors here.  This case's flexibility makes it a leader as it swivels, and detaches, allowing seemingly unlimited combinations of viewing and portability.  The set-up (the way it positions/stands) also allows rigidity for users who want to use the iPad like a laptop, with screen fixed upright in place.  Unlike most iPad cases which require you hold the unit still, or leave on a flat surface, the NT38B Airbender stays in position.  The case is also quite rugged.  As a tech guy, I've experienced many cases that promise to protect, but at the end of the day protect only from scratches.  This case is rugged, solid.  Another phenomenal option is the ability to easily detach the iPad from the keyboard while keeping the iPad in it's case.  The iPad then can stand alone in various positions while you type.  The battery is also quite reliable.  I've had the unit for weeks now and have not had to recharge yet.  Two items that could improve this product, which I have NOT seen in other \"like\" items:  grip surface on outside of case, and further improved keyboard experience.  Most iPad keyboards have the same issue: the keys do not tap as well as they do on a Macbook/laptop.  Overall, a SOLID product."}, {"review_id": "65cacfa12faca14681b18bd28c1d4c5a", "review": "I love this product for my iPAD Retina!  I use the iPad for personal and business use which is why I need the keyboard.  The keyboard does take some time to adapt to as the keys are not quite as contoured as those of a regular keyboard.  I have adapted well and I would be lost without the keyboard.  The case is very convenient with the several different options available for display.  I have found that it works best if you hold on to the bottom of the ipad screen when adjusting the prop on the back to get the best angle.  In addition, when opening the case for use, it works best if you hold the screen portion up and pull down on the keyboard, rather than the normal procedure for opening a laptop.  The ability to completely disconnect the iPad portion from the keyboard is also a nice touch.  The keyboard holds a great charge and I can go a full week before it will need a charge."}], "B005IHAIEI": [{"review_id": "693c38ac9f18b90052df850e9ccb337e", "review": "Love this camera and now use it for everything.Have been using it for a few months now and taken thousands of photos with it.So far have yet to find something i do not like about this camera.Was easy to use right out of the box.I have not even gone over the full 200+ pages of information on all the features that are on the enclosed cd yet.You will want to take time to devote to learning all you can about all the many different features on the camerabecause there is so much it can do -I have not had any issues with video stopping while taping.I am just an average camera user not a pro.Originally before digital i learned on a Canon SLR that i still have on handbut have not used film in over ten years.Have gone through many many digital point and shoots and even have two that i now no longer usebecause i am so spoiled with this one and just picking a couple features that i want to focus oni do not have the kinds of frustration that i have had in the past with things liketrying to get the right white balance or getting my blues and purples righteven the low light and motion photos we have taken are amazing.I love the ability to change taking one photo or many at one time have been able to get fun summer action photos of the kids this wayI have shared with people when they ask which camera i have had i like best and i say the Sony NEX-7 you can not go wrong withyes the price point is not going to be for everyone however someone like mei have had over 12 different point and shoots from Kodak Nexus Sony Canon take all the money i have spent in the pasti should have just invested in something like this that will last long past many of the ones i now have sitting on the shelvesand been happier with the photos captured to keep that  fleeting moment in time"}], "B005JN9310": [{"review_id": "c8d5468b7441df2404eaa8ee6b095274", "review": "This is a very nice monitor that meets all my expectations.  It is replacing a 5 year old Samsung monitor that just failed in a triple monitors setup.  The older Samsung was a higher end one in the Samsung lineup at the time.  The U2412M is a little clearer and has good color.  The monitor is thinner and lighter and the base has a smaller footprint allowing me to set the monitor so it is further back on my desk reclaiming a few inches of desk space.  Since it is LED backlit it uses much less power than my other monitors.  I'm considering replacing the other monitors with U2412M monitors although it is hard to bite the bullet on that since the other monitors are working OK and they look fine next to each other for my purposes (data and charts).  I bought this at a higher price from one vendor on Amazon as they offered Amazon Prime shipping (overnight is $3.99) and I needed the monitor right away.

To some who have made listening to music a part of their lives for the better part of their lives, it usually does not take long at all for one truth to become glaringly and disturbingly apparent: no longer could the music speak for itself. The mandates of the compression algorithms now dictate what we hear.I don't want to raise the spectre of arguments like this long passed- the cassette tape, the CD- for that matter, people were probably bitching about the change from shellac to vinyl.But one fact remains unalterable: MP3's mess with the music. And using them in evaluating any sound reproduction device, i.e. speakers, headphones, earbuds, strikes me as not dissimilar from using Applebee's food to evaluate cutlery.This is by no means intended to be a slam at Applebees, but the point for which I strive is how can you tell if you are dining on the best when what you are eating is a faulty reproduction of the real thing?Having cleared the air with that, I can move on to say that MP3's have forced even the most casual but dedicated music appreciator into the same niche as the true audiophile- suddenly, it makes a difference.So then how to judge and review? Where is the benchmark? I would split with a broadaxe the subject into two categories: did it come with a 1/8\" mini-plug, or a true \" audio connector?As these cans came with the former, we must assume that they were primarily intended for the MP3 and portable music crowd in general. The slick foldability of the design furthers this theory. The aforementioned plug is of a slim design, clearly intended to fit into any device with any shell.It is also angled at a 45, the first time I have seen this and at once settling the argument of straight up or 90.That they are Bose insures two things: the sound quality promises that they will be superior, and that they are probably overpriced.In back to back tests with a particular favorite album using my new benchmark Sennheiser cans, the Bose did OK- I noticed they seem to deliver more volume at a lower setting from the playback device, in this case an iPod Classic.While the sound was clear and relatively distinct, I would say that's about it. The bass response was adequate, nothing special. After the truly sensual experience of the over the ear Sennheisers, going back to an on-ear device such as this is a letdown.But there can be no argument that the quality is superb, the \"knockdown\" and storage of these phones is very nicely executed,although it does seem that they would not take well to rough handling. So, unlike others I have seen, they come with a semi-rigid case that's roughly (and ironically) the size of a CD, and well built to stand the rigors of travel. To test this theory I may pass them along to my flight attendant sister for the analysis of a true road- or sky warrior.All in all, there are too many choices, and yours will probably be determined in part by reviews such as this, what your friends say, and ultimately what brand you choose to advertise on your head. You can do worse than the Bose for the same price, but I believe with more diligent study you might also do better."}], "B005KOZNBW": [{"review_id": "efaf6d4c754b35594465ed5f87954d3f", "review": "Purchased this because my old Western Digital WDTV Gen2 was having serious issues playing newer MKV files. Preferred this over the WDTV Live Hub because it has a faster processor and more memory (512MB vs 256MB in the Live Hub), so is overall more powerful than the WDTV Live Hub. Also liked the included Wireless N capability.After unboxing it and using it for a day I have pros and cons immediately.Pros1. Far better remote than previous models. I like the better size and more ergonomic shape, the bottom has a rubber sort of material.2. The new Mochi UI is actually a pleasing sight and works well compared to older versions.3. Everything seems to play, but still occasional bug (see Cons). Newer MKV files will work.4. Doesn't get very warm even when playing high bitrate 1080p video.Cons1. Wireless N is flaky and lacks range. If you are 3-5 feet from the router it's fine. Anything beyond that, 20+ feet, good luck. Upon using WPS to connect to wireless router it initially worked but doesn't seem to want to connect anymore afterwards. So do not purchase this based upon it's wireless. I'm looking at using a wireless access point as a better alternative.2. Although it will play media like MKV files it still has issues with them on occasion.

I bought the Roku 2XS and heavily considered the Apple TV before this one (I have an Iphone and Ipad). I ended up returning the Roku, not ordering the Apple TV and keeping this one. Why? Please read along.FYI, you can jump right into the PROS and CONS if you don't want to see my rationale and comparison of WD to Roku and AppleTVMy decision on buying and keeping the WD was heavily influenced by its claim (and now after trying it for a month, I declare it \"truth\") that it plays any format of video you throw at it. It does. AVI, MKV, MP4, MPEG, anything. You throw it in, it plays to perfection. On comparison, AppleTV barely plays anything non-Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats. Other than every other MKV it played NOTHING. Deal breaker.If your main or primary goal is streaming I would suggest the Roku over the WD. Especially if you have Amazon Prime (not supported by WD). It is sleeker, has a much more elegant remote and a smaller box.Coming back the WD: The main function, streaming, works flawlessly in HD setting (at my internet speed of 20MBPs download, 3MBPS upload). Navigation menu is easy to navigate and is well laid out. Not as good as Roku,I might add.Overall it is good but not great and a quick recap as to why is below in the PROS and CONSPROS+ Plays ANYTHING you throw at it via USB+ HD playback is excellent+ You can skip to \"desired time\" as opposed to going with the 2X to 16X forward speed. Sounds trivial but is very helpful when tried+ Has a free remote APP you can download from the APP store (don't know about Android)CONS- No Amazon Prime (I don't get this. Understand AppleTV not offering it but why WD, why?)- Terrible remote like the 1980's VHS player remotes) . You need to push the keys really harr and have close to perfect line of sight to the box- Netflix app asks you to confirm your account every other day. Annoying. Needs an update to fix this.Finally, which player is better fit for who:- WD : If you have multiple formats of videos to watch on your TV and use Netflix, hulu, hulu+ or vudu (plus pandora and a few other music stations) this is for you- Roku : If you want to watch all the mainstream streaming services and Amazon Prime and not care for USB video playback of various video formats, this is for you- AppleTV: If you want to remain in the Apple universe, have an extremely slick gadget (and remote), have the ability to mirror your IPAD or IPhone on your HDTV, and you don't care for Amazon Prime then this is for youOverall, I am very happy with my purchase despite it comes with a remote, that at first look wants you wonder what the heck they were thinking."}, {"review_id": "6136b5a72cb14b0551610526201d8dbb", "review": "I bought this specifically because it would allow me to stream my home media.

I actually bought 3 monitors because I am running SLI configuration for programming and for gaming. Because I have such a small desk, at the moment, I had to angle the monitors 75 degrees from the center monitor.  So if you can picture that in your mind, I want to say I have NO problem seeing anything. The colors still look great and gaming is just as fun. Only problem (this is not the monitors fault) is my head hurts from turning lol, just wanted to share that :PSome might ask if the 21 inch is too small. I can say I was worried about this too because I was using my PS3 3d display beforehand and can say that text is a fraction of a bit smaller. Unless you have really bad eyes, these monitors are perfect size. I also like the size because I have heard the bigger you go, the more you can see the LED backlight. In my case I can say on a totally black screen I see MINOR backlighting; nothing that would make the screen look awful, don't let that turn you away from the monitor.Some reviewers have had bad outcomes with dead pixels and what not, I bought 3. Not one of them has had any problem except for user error. This user error was I thought all 3 monitors were dead because when I \"touched\" the power button it didn't respond. Don't fall victim like I did, the power button is under the screen, it is not a fancy touch sensitive button like I thought, again user error. You have plenty of connection options except display port but that is alright because I prefer DVI and HDMI so it really is user preference. No speakers but again doesn't bother me, I use a headset. Lastly, the design is sleek but the stand feels cheap. Just touching the monitor a little and you will notice a bouncing effect (monitor rocks back and forth). This could have been made better but I don't plan on moving them or touching them so not a big deal breaker.So overall I am very happy with the purchase. The picture looks great at all angles, the frame rate if perfect (even for hardcore gaming, tested BF3 with ultra-settings, SLI 670s, and all three monitors in surround mode and it was PERFECT/BREATHTAKING), and the price couldn't be any more appealing for IPS.

It was a choice between this monitor and its replacement, theAOC e1659Fwu 16-Inch USB-Powered Portable LCD Monitor (Latest Version). The primary difference is the newer one uses USB 3.0 and costs $40 more. So far as I can tell, the USB 3.0 only offers a faster data transfer rate. As I was only using it to surf the web and view PDF documents, that capability was inconsequential and made the E1649FWU a better deal for me. That said, I have watched videos and such and have seen no lag or other delays.The monitor is nice and bright and works very simply. Once you install the drivers, the monitor auto adjusts between portrait and landscape modes.There are a couple of downsides to this monitor. It is extremely wide screen, so in portrait mode, PDF files tend to be very small. The monitor takes two USB ports, so you may want to purchase a powered USB hub if you are running short.

Compact, HD video and stills, and Wi-Fi connectivity to convenient sharing sites.There is good and bad.I originally felt there was a lot more BAD with this camera, but after additional testing I have given this camera a better rating.At this time the Bloggie cannot connect to Facebook: Trying to do so takes the user to a SONY web page that informs you that the Facebook upload service is temporarily not working and will not be available \"until December\". (Note, I am writing this in March.) The SONY rep I spoke with says they are currently working on this issue and the December Date is not realistic. He believes it will be corrected in the next couple of weeks. I have to mention, that Sony's customer service did help me through a few the problems I was having with set-up and function. This made the difference between me returning the camera and keeping it.Connecting and Uploading to my I-phone via wi-fi is a little touchy. When it works; it works fine. There are times when I am in areas that something, in the air, blocks the signal between the two devices. When it works this is a convenient feature. I bought this camera so I would not tax my I-phone with home video file bloat. It's nice to be able to grab a picture from the Bloggie via wi-fi and then edit the image using one the photo editing apps I have on my I-phone.Uploading to You-tube worked. I didn't run into any problems uploading a video to You-Tube and video appeared on the site in a minute.Connecting to Playmemories, the Sony photo/video upload site, worked well. The connection to the site was not always solid and uploaded images dropped about 25% of the times I tried. I can't tell if this is a wi-fi problem or a problem with the Playmemories site. Maybe I am missing a control feature, but I noticed that ALL photos and Videos upload to the site upon connecting. I would prefer that it allowed me to check images and videos for uploading.Recording LIVE video to the QIK web site, after an account is set up, worked really well. I was actually impressed at how easy this was.At first I was really disappointed in the fact that the focus ring creates a tapping noise that can be heard on the video. After additional testing I have found that the condenser mic hears this woodpecker-tapping sound when there is no other sound in the room. The mic opens up and listens for sound and the sound it picks up is the focus mechanism. I noticed that the tapping sound was not loud when other sounds were in the room. Considering I am using this movie for blogging and home vacation home movies, this tapping is no longer much of a bother to me.The video is very clear. The focus function is slow to react to subject distance changes. I would suggest setting up a shot if you can, tap the screen so the camera focuses on your subject and then start recording.At another Amazon customer's suggestion, I tested the recording length time:In HD, the camera stayed in record mode for 24 1/2 minutes before it stopped recording. It does not automatically start recording another file. You have to start a new recording manually. This isn't a problem for home movie recording, but it would be a problem if you're recording a performance, play, musical event or other lengthy topic where you would want the camera to keep rolling. If this is your need, get a bigger camera.While recording video you can press the snapshot button on the top of the camera and get some nice still-shots on the fly. I really liked this feature.The images are crisp but I feel the shutter speed is a little slow so, if your subject is moving, expect a little blurring.I used kept this camera in my pocket over the last few days and really used it. I recorded indoors and outdoors and, despite a few out-of-focus shots, I really got some nice clean, crisp video that I'm happy with.I wish SONY had allowed for a memory bump via a card slot.After getting the camera set-up on my computer, connection and image upload has been really easy. The files are compatible with all of my video editing programs and the video looks really nice when it's burned to DVD.For the money I spent, I couldn't find anything else on the market that offered what this camera does."}], "B006OBGEHW": [{"review_id": "ce8ad48b3a60d3cfe842e29a4e0457bf", "review": "The MoKo Slim-Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7Before I give my reasons why, let me note this case comes with no instructions, like so many products. Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical."}, {"review_id": "fd8aab8b8081bc2785fe0cd7578be8d2", "review": "Outstanding fit and finish.

For years, I worked with a D-Link DIR-655 - which was fine, for the most part.

Since we now have 2 Tivo's, 2 Xbox 360s, an Apple TV, a Roku box, an iPad, 2 computers, a wireless printer and 2 iPhones (amongst other things) seeking out a WiFi signal, the old router just couldn't cut it.

The Apple TV seemed to NEVER be able to connect to my PC.

The review has been accurate in my case and I have seen an improvement in both range and performance over my previous WRT 350N  router.On the downside like many reviews I read I found the firmware to be unstable.  That is within the first 24 hours the router had dropped all the wireless connections in the house and devices were not able to connect consistently.  Having read many reviews and some forums I knew this was a possibility but I also new that I had options.  There are 3 alternative firmware versions available that will all work on this router so if the stock asus firmware is not fitting the bill you have a choice of Merlin, Tomato or DD-WRT.  At this point however a simple update to the latest Asus firmware resolve my problem and the router has been stable since that time.There are some other things I do not like about the Asus software:Parental Controls - The only option here is to set a calendar of access times.  The Web 2.0 interface is awkward and you must set a different schedule for each MAC address.  I found it time consuming and problematic.  I would have preferred to create an access class assign the schedule to the access class and then assign the MAC address to the class.  But at least I was able to disable WIFI during nighttime hours so my children aren't watching HULU or worse all night in bed.Static IP - While it gives you the ability to create leases, you cannot name them.  And as such the DNS from the router will not serve a name for them.  This has been a feature I have used for a while and has been available on every previous router that I have purchased.  It makes it easy to setup a static entry for my ReadyNAS, and networked Xerox printer and then access them in a browser by name instead of IP.  All of the alternative firmwares provide this capability so I will likely switch to one of them, going to try Merlin first as it has the best performance.QoS - I really don't get it, why would you invent your own version of QoS when a standard 802.11Q already exists and would make your device compliant with other devices that also support the standard such as my 24 port gigabit switch.  The lack of this feature has effectively nullified the capability on my 24 port switch as I have no congestion within the switch, only when accessing the internet.  Instead they provide a very dumbed down custom QoS implementation that has been very buggy by all reports.  I am hoping that I might be able to get 802.11q with DDWRT or Tomato, but doubt that Merlin will provide it.In general the interface is just simplified, and it is clear that it was intended for the novice user.  Some advanced features are available, but for the most part it is designed for the non-technical user.To be clear, I find the problems above endemic across all SOHO offerings.  They are adequate, but dumbed down for grandma to the point they do not work the way a technologist would expect.  Based on the performance I am seeing with update firmware, I can highly recommend this if you need a Dual Band WIFI router, I have deducted 1 star because you will need to flash the firmware to get it to be stable."}, {"review_id": "825c5b3cbadfa4c18ba79a27f27639c0", "review": "I needed a Gigabit (should there be any less now-a-days?) wifi access point.

It was a mixture of video, audio and text files roughly 5GB in size.The computers on both ends are Gig capable BTW.  This transfer went smooth and fast.

Took about a minute to get the router talking with my Motorola cable modem and set up the dual band wireless ssid's. My laptop is configured to the 5GHz band and runs awesome now! With the mediabridge router the wireless signal was highly unstable on all my wireless devices.Once the user interface for the ASUS was dialed in, it prompted me to download the latest firmware - which was an effortless process - siimply following screen instructions. Now, I am also using QoS for browsing, HD media streaming, and gaming. This product really works the way a router is supposed to. Not to mention the physical aesthetics of the router, esp. when you put it up on the stand it comes with it -The Dark Knight look ;-). The wireless range is awesome - options for setting up guest ssids on both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands is an excellent feature.

After the second time I decided to switch from Linksys (been a fanboy for the past decade) - and I couldn't be more happier. The vertical range on this unit is far superior to the e3k - that is 3 stories above it and I have near 4/5 bars on my cell phone and laptop. Whereas the e3k was between 2/5 - 3/5. Likewise a test 1 floor up and about 250 feet away gave me 3/5 bars - nearly full bandwidth speed. I can also transfer on my internal network at nearly 60MB/s when in good signal - something I'd never achieve with the e3k. I wish I had better benchmarks however since the e3k is dead I couldn't do solid tests to compare it with. However I can state without a doubt, every location I could stand in my house and outside my house - I got better signal. Likewise any location I could stand in I got faster bandwidth both internally and externally (that is I could get my full 50mb/s download bandwidth from my ISP - where my e3k I rarely saw get above 35).If I had to point out any flaws with this unit it would probably be the weird base/mount that it sits on to elevate the back end. It's useful and almost needed for cooling (like most high end routers - this gets hot), however it doesnt sit so well on it, they couldve made it so it slid in/attached somehow so it seemd more solid.Also to note this router is fully supported by DDWRT - I've been running it several months without any issues. There were some weird stock firmware isues with Asus when I first got it, but Asus has since resolved. Their stock firmware is pretty decent, functional, and will suffice for most users I'm sure.

But, the replacement worked just fine and I will detail how that went.I made the decision to contact ASUS to have them walk me through the complete process (never did this before &#8211; always did it on my own).  In reality, I did not need their assistance until the end of the setup where it asks me to update the firmware.  I was advised to download it to the computer (on the desktop makes the most sense so you can easily find it later) and update it manually once the remaining steps are completed.I then accessed the router and manually updated the firmware.  The process was fairly simple and was completed quickly.  With the exception of the initial firmware issue &#8211; which is the reason for 4 stars versus 5 &#8211; I have been very happy with the router.  Having the USB ports have been great (attached a printer and an external hard drive) and the coverage has been excellent.I do think this is an excellent router &#8211; once you get past the firmware issue.  It does have great coverage with powerful coverage.  As I noted above, the USB ports have been nice to make further use of the router.

The player is light and easy to connect, so I can move it easily and quickly. I guess I didn't realize how quickly technology has advanced in the past few years because I was blown away by how many different apps are on this thing (on top of the Netflix and Prime).  You can play word games, watch a whole bunch of different TVapps and even turn your TV into a virtual fire place. I cancelled my cable about a year ago because of the monthly cost and have been relying on Netflix and Amazon, so having these extra shows to check out was really exciting. This may be standard now, I don't know.  I guess I am a little behind the times?  Here I thought Blu-Ray players were just for, you know... BluRays!

The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all \"HD\" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to \"pair\".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it \"thinks\" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.  The 3D is amazing."}], "B006ZP8UOW": [{"review_id": "79994ac3c6d4ef49fa4dd47ecae1885b", "review": "It is really a great little camera, when it first connected to my wireless.

The picture is good and the control work good as well. You have to pay for the full app for you phone. I think that sucks. The problems started when I tried to set up the remote access through the web. You have to subscribe to a web host for a minimal charge in order to be able to view your camera remotely from the web. The instructions are very vague and the quality of the instruction video that is on the install CD is really poor. It looks like they took the picture with a toaster. You would think a camera company would have a pristine video. Well it has been two weeks and I have played with it a few time, but still no luck. I have two weeks to get this set up as I wanted it to check on my house when I go on a extended vacation. I just don't get why they have to make things so difficult. I am no dummy when it comes to computers and networking. If I do ever figure this thing out, I will probably buy one or two more to spread out in my house.Update 11/9/13: I called Foscam and they remoted on to my computer and set up the web browsing for me. Turns out that I had done everything right, it is just that you need to use a different network connection to view your camera over the web than the one the camera is on. They should state this loud and clear somewhere. Also, you do not need to sign up to a web host to get access. Foscam gives you a free connection. The remote app works great over WiFi or a wired connection, but is very sluggish and slow over a cell connection. I used this while we went on vacation for two weeks. You can set up alarms so when the camera detects sound or motion it will email you 6 pictures. Got worried one AM when it showed people in my house. Turns out it was the cleaning lady who got the dates mixed up. I was not able to figure out who was in the picture by sight, but when I put two and two together and figured out that was her normal day, I could see it was her. So, the picture could be better.

I noticed no picture quality difference so I returned the contrast setting to 4 after the reboot.I am finding this 640 x 480 quality camera perfect for basic surveillance and security.  It has an excellent mounting bracket and utility/control program.  I mounted it on the ceiling upside down.  The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet caf&eacute; to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.  People looking for HD video surveillance should look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "a1af8522c85239506aa0e4e924a67e45", "review": "Okay, First I will start with my opinion that I really dislike when people give a tech product a negative review and call it things like worthless, or broken simply because they don't have simple know how on setting up the tech, even something easy as a wifi network at home.Here are the facts:IT WORKS!!: I used the set up manual, followed directions, and I was up online; first with a wired connection via ethernet cable, secondly with wireless through my wifi network.IT'S EASY!!: Following the straight forward directions I was able to be up and running in minutes!Here is the twist, which in no way is the products fault.. I needed to have a port forwarding service, which you know of if you've been reading these reviews. Without this service I could only observe my camera's feed through my home network and only on my home network.Do you need to pay for a subscription service? no! &#34;NO/IP&#34; has a free basic service with no special features that let me accomplish my requirements for a home IP camera. At first my connection wasn't working after the simple DDNS setup on NO/IP but that was my internet service provider blocking the connection through a firewall. I found online a PDF with instructions from my ISP giving me exact directions on how to allow the camera to operate freely on the network. I then typed the info from the instructions, rebooted the camera, and I WAS UP AND RUNNING.If connected to wifi, the new forwarding adress would not work, if not connected to wifi and running on 3G, the forwarding address WOULD work.BOTTOM LINE, MORAL OF THE STORY, I had everything I needed completed in less then a few hours!. The initial camera set up, IN MINUTES!I was also able to set up my gmail account to send me an alert email if motion is detected on my camera, and was able to program which days and times to send out these alerts.The IR feature works great, and the pan and tilt works great too, only downside is no zoom feature which would have been a perfect addition. The software is barebones and does the job, and I also installed an easy set up Iphone app for remote monitoring called &#34;IP Cam Viewer&#34; which only cost a few bucks, no subscription fee.Four stars to start, will be five after getting some use time in.WHO CARES ABOUT THE AUDIO?

Often I use the two-way audio to give them commands.  The original setup was not that difficult if you follow the instructions.  On my network it has a static IP and port mapping allows me to make it available over the Internet.The night vision works well, but does tend to see-through certain thin clothing.  This isn't a big issue, but it is worth noting that it may not be appropriate in some use cases.  During the day the color tends to falter leaving it a little washed out.My experience is that at 12 feet in darkness you can no longer distinguish between objects 1-2 inches in size.  To frame this, if you put a $1 bill on the floor next to a $20 bill you would struggle to identify which is which.  At 20 feet in darkness you will lose edge definition on items.  Anything beyond tends to reach the limit of the infrared range.In bright light you will add a couple of feet to each of the measures above.  The reason for mentioning this is that you may not want to locate the camera in a ceiling where it is inherently 10-12 feet away from any relevant objects.  Also, the camera as pictured with the product has the base pointed down.  To gain the most range of freedom you will want to mount the camera upside-down and flip the rotational axis.  This is supported in the software.The video recording features do not appear to work on my firmware.  The snapshot features require you to login before they work.  I had planned to have the stills grabbed every couple of minutes available to the public and the pan/tilt adjustments requiring a password.  To get around this I had to setup a PHP script to authenticate and store the images on a server.  Then people can access the images without logging in.The audio quality of the microphone is reasonable.  The speaker on the camera is poor and I highly recommend that when mounting the camera you add a set of powered speakers available on Amazon for cheap.The only downside is that there is an upper limit on concurrent viewers on the camera.  After five concurrent viewers the camera tends to become non-responsive to commands through the GUI.  The second camera of the same model with the newer firmware does not have this same issue.  Regardless, I highly recommend this camera and have recommended it to friends.When it finally goes up to 1080p or 720p my goal is to upgrade these units."}, {"review_id": "dc92c06ccad1f43e3c3c096f2dd4cb27", "review": "Wireless works well on it, gets a good signal. 802.11gI have had mine up for awhile now and have not had one issue with it.

Both apps were free and work great (although the Mac app doesn't support audio from this camera, it's still a great free app).I did review the lengthy negative app regarding issues some users have had with the camera.  I take reports like this with a grain of salt - First, it's an inexpensive camera - I don't expect MILSPEC hardware, and I'm willing to make a gamble at this price, as compared to other IP cameras that cost a LOT more.  Second, working in the customer support industry I know a lot of minor issues can get blown WAY out of proportion by a small group of vocal on-line users.

I wanted something that I could view remotely from my desktop at work and my iPhone4.  I had done quite a bit of searching around for a solid IP camera before I settled on this.  I had looked at d-link, tenvis, wanscam, and others.  However, none of those had the number of views that Foscam had or the number of helpful setup tips.  Soo after long deliberation I decided this was reasonable to get even after I had some concerns related to reviews and security.  To break it down further -What I like:+Price+Size of the camera (It is not an extremely large camera by any means.  Good to keep \"hidden\" in a tight location)+IR cut (Adds a more realistic color.  Not washed out.  Take a look at AwkwardHamster's youtube video comparing other foscam models)+Accessing the camera remotely (It's good once you get pass the setup portion, which I explain in my comments)+Picture quality - Good (Don't expect it to be the sharpest quality.  You are not going to see a hair on the ground 5 feet away.  If you are expecting long distance use with this camera don't expect amazing quality images)+Wide variety of settingsWhat I didn't like:-Power cord (~3ft, who does that?)-Reviews, a bit off topic but I want to make a comment about all of them.  Now I didn't like that so many reviews on Amazon start off by saying \"I couldn't get my camera to connect so I contacted 'insert name here' from Foscam.  They connected the cameras in no time and were extremely helpful'.  At the time of this review 703 similar statements.  Now I find this somewhat fishy that 703 comments are similar.  It seems to me that it is a modified template for comments.  I can't say whether these statements are true or not but just keep it in mind that some if not all may be false comments.  Just my 2 cents.-Minimal information on remote DNS providers.  DNS provider - used to access camera outside of your home network.-Security encryption.  From what I have read in other comments this camera has no security when you try and remotely access this camera.  If you attempt to access it remotely your username/password is sent in \"Plain Text\".  This means if you use public wifi your password can be \"sniffed\" out.  Now this might of concern to some and others it's no big deal.  So I suggest for some to do more research on how to access your camera securely.  I personally plan on setting up the camera for viewing through a VPN (virtual private network).  I haven't done it yet but the goal is to purchase a router that has VPN capability and install tomato or dd-wrt.Stuck between like/don't like:>Camera setup.  This is a tough one.

Tickle's\" instructions from March 29, 2012 to set the camera up.  Here is what he used with slight modifications and explanations that may make it easier for some.1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  The CD is used to try and find the camera.  On my first attempt to access my camera I did toss the CD in and install the software, but unfortunately I was left with a blank text box with no camera IP.  The manual said I should reinstall the software so I did.  That didn't work so I decided to find it using my router web login explained below.2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.  My camera came with a coiled up cat-5 cable.  You shouldn't have to go searching for one.3) Login to your router (via browser, for linksys it is 192.168.1.1) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.  This should be fairly easy to do especially if you have the Linksys smart router.  Navigate to your connected devices and copy the cameras IP address.4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.  Copy and Paste the IP address for the camera into a new blank tab and hit enter.  This should take you to the foscam page that shows activex, server push mode, and mobile phone.  If you use IE select activex, firefox/chrome use server push mode.  Selecting one of those will give you a pop-up for username/password.  The default username/password is : Username-admin, there is no password.  Once you get in you can navigate to \"Basic Network Settings\"  and uncheck DHCP.5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.  This step is pretty simple.  You can assign your camera an IP address.  I used the IP it was initially assigned except I changed the last three numbers xxx.xxx.x.151.  Next you want to fill in the subnet mask, which can be found in your router settings or I believe it mostly is 255.255.255.0 (per google search of course).  Enter in your gateway IP and DNS server IP (you will use the same IP address for both of these.  you can find this IP address from your router login page in maybe a \"local networks\" tab it should be the IP address of your router).  The last thing you can fill in is the HTTP port.  Select a four digit number such as \"5252\".  Remember this because it will be used to setup port forwarding.  Now hit SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.  Now that you have your IP address for your camera nailed down you may wish to go into your router and assign the IP camera a static IP address.  This ensures another device will not accidentally take your foscam IP address.6) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.  Hit SUBMIT, this will reboot the camera.  Now you you can unplug the camera from your router.  ***NOTE*** I have found that once you enable wireless on the camera it may take some time to actually connect to your wifi network.  So if you reboot your camera be patient (more than 1 minute patient).  Watch the camera for the green LED to have a steady and consistent blink.  Any hesitation in blinking means it has not connected yet.7) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working and your settings have stayed.8) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.  You will also have to enter in the device IP address, the one you just gave the camera.9) Now in order to access the camera remotely you will need a DDNS service.  Foscam now recommends \"no-ip\" for free DNS instead of dydns.  Do a google search for it.  Create an account.  Foscam has their own service free for 3 years but after that you will have to pony up some money.  No-ip is free but and has one downfall, every 30 days you will need to say you will keep the DNS assigned to you.  I haven't had the service for more than 30 days, but from what I have found online you receive an email and have to navigate to a link that is in the email.  I guess this is the price you pay for a free service.10) Go back to your camera settings.  Select DDNS Service Settings then Select third party DDNS drop down and find no-ip.  Enter your username and password.  This is the information you used on the no-ip site to create an account.  Finally you will want to enter in the ddns host.  This is what you set up to be your camera website/host.  Example:  mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz.  Sorry about the dots, trying to avoid having information blocked.  Now click SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.11) Now try and access your camera using your new host.  You can try this from 3G/4G to make sure you can connect outside your home network.  Open browser tab and enter in all the host information.  Using my example: mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz:5252.  If you notice I entered  :5252  after the host name.  This is because we changed it earlier in step 5.12) You now should be able to connect remotely.  Since the hard part is done go and change your username and password to the camera if you haven't done that yet.I hope these steps help lower the frustration of setting up this camera.My final comment!!IP Camera APPS. I mentioned earlier that I had an iPhone and wanted to access the cameras for remote viewing.  After much searching I decided to download \"LiveCams Pro\" right now $3.99 in the appstore.  I selected it after seeing others recommend it and seeing all the cameras they support.  I may or may not want a different camera manufacturer such as d-link and the app supports them.  However, this is not the only app available, Foscam has an app (not free) that you can download.  From what I have found it works well but other than that I haven't had experience with it.I will update with my opinion of the camera as time goes on.  Feel free to check back in a few months."}], "B006ZS5ATM": [{"review_id": "197e760a49907baeff809b2ccdfe466f", "review": "I had a smaller headset that went on the ear.

I got them and just as the comment said, they weren't working, so I looked up what to do and found solutions really easily online, now they work perfectly and amazingly. Sound quality is awesome. 7.1 in headphones?!?!?! Deal me in! They really are as comfortable as they look, build quality is just as nice, and the Mic is super clear. So if you're looking for a decent headset for pretty cheap, go with these :)"}, {"review_id": "b1f8016c33ac0d6d02a5c3a3bfd85025", "review": "Decent sound, but there are negatives to considerThe quality of the construction and materials seems average. I would prefer if they were a little better built, but they're acceptable for the price. The fabric used on the ear pieces and the head padding is the same fabric they use in fabric lint rollers. It's soft enough, but collects lint accordingly. The mic boom is flexible rubber and decent quality, but it doesn't allow you to adjust its location in and out and sits further from the mouth than expected.Pros:Sound - The sound quality is very decent. I'm not an audiophile so take it with a grain of salt, but both games and music are quite enjoyable for me with this headset.Comfort - At first I found these uncomfortable and pinching which after an hour of use caused significant discomfort. However, once I lowered the ear pieces to wear this a bit loose (more loose than I normally prefer headphones) they fit much better. After hours of use they are still comfortable for me.Microphone - The mic is very sensitive and picks up sound really well.Cons:USB - The USB interface is one you want to avoid for headsets if you have a good soundcard. USB headsets include their own audio card built-in to the device in order to work. Therefore, using these will bypass the soundcard in your computer.  Also, the USB cable is quite short. This device isn't compatible with USB 3.0. Since I only have 3.0 on the front panel of my computer I would prefer a longer cord to run it from the back.Dolby - The simulated 7.1 is not appealing to me. It simulates surround by making the audio more `spatial'. This doesn't add to the audio quality though; it makes the sound worse in my opinion. The default setting is off,Volume Control - The volume control is a rocker switch in a convenient location on the back of the left ear-piece. The rocker switch is annoying. You rotate and hold it in one direction or the other to change the volume. I would prefer a dial instead of holding a switch.No Audio Controls - This device has no equalizer to adjust the audio. The audio levels it ships with is okay, but if you wanted to customize your sound you should purchase a different headset.Microphone - The mic is overly sensitive and even on low input volumes it picks up any background noise like you mouse and keyboard, breathing, etc.In summary, decent sound and comfort for the price, but has some limitations."}], "B0073FE1F0": [{"review_id": "54e9ec6fc033f1a7e9965d8797ad35b5", "review": "This charger is perfect for my nightstand where I charge both my iPad and iPhone.... now I don't have to fight to find where my lamp plugs in!

I bought the &#34;body only&#34; kit so it would force me to use the Pentax lenses. The camera has some nice features that compensate for lenses that do not have auto focus, and I was able to figure this out after some time. Eventually I was able to use my zoom lens and several prime lenses, and one lens that did have auto focus. I found the focus peaking feature the best way to focus with the manual focus lenses. I was able to get several sharp photographs. However, I could not use it outside, I just could not see the screen in bright light. The only thing I could see was the focus peaking lines which helped me get a few good shots, but most outside shots were out of focus. Also the remote control software was minimal. I also discovered that when the HDMI cable is plugged in, it only supports playback and does not support live view. The battery life was dismal, it is more a function of how long the camera is on rather than the specified number of shots you can take. The battery was good for a few hours, then died. I would recommend this camera as an option for indoor and not-so-bright outdoor shooting, especially if you have Pentax lenses.

I'm just going to say that the screen looks great, speakers are the best ever, and it's solid.But what I will include in my review is a few opinions.1) the bigger version is better.  Yeah it's the same hardware and software for the most part, but the extra screen space is really really worthwhile.  If you've got *any* spare cash, please consider 8.9 over the 7.2) accessories that should be included.  Amazon was great enough to include a USB cable, but that's it.  No covers, bumpers, screen protect or even a charger.  Yulp, not even a charger.  You do get the option to bundle things at a discount when you buy this, and it's to your best interest to do so.  Pick up the charger for $9.99, because when you change your mind later on, it's $19.99 separately.  Also, if you consider going mobile or throwing it in your purse, consider a screen protector or cover.  It will reduce the greatness of the screen slightly, but you really don't want scratches.  A spare cable is also really nice if you travel a lot.3) Ads.  It really urks me that you have to pay to have ads removed.  This is just amazon milking a little more money from the customer base.  You can find very similar tablets that match features and hardware for $199.99 that doesn't cram advertisements on your device.Overall I would not purchase this device for myself.  I feel that pricing it for $199 is kind of dishonest.  It cost to remove ads, it cost to add a charger, by the time you're said and done it's really closer to $225 before tax.  For relatively the same hardware and features and $199 price tag, I would recommend Nook HD or Nexus 7.  The only plus side is the tight integration to Amazon's electronic services. It's an alright buy for prime members, but if you don't have prime you should pass.PS, It really does have great speakers"}, {"review_id": "d85d4d0841ffc40b672c493c66d38447", "review": "Purchased it as a gift for my husband for his graduation from college (he did it while working 60 hours and being a fulltime student - not easy!)

Im sure most have mentioned there is no \"power block\", just a USB cable. You can get a 50% discount on it at time of purchase IF you go through amazon. More about this later.Setting the devices up was easy for the most part. I have no idea why no one sets the interface up to show you the MAC when connecting to an AP (access point). [The MAC might be needed if your filtering clients on your wireless network by MAC address] I have to forgo setting the device up then find the MAC and backtrack to set the device up. Other than that it seems fine. I do notice that when in FreeTime app that when I move from one wireless network to another it doesn't pick up automatically, more on this later.The tablet is very responsive. I'm quite impressed. Everything is fluid and gives me a good feeling about using it. I don't feel like I'm waiting on the device to catch up with my movements.Freetime and Freetime Unlimited are the reasons I went with the Kindle Fire HD, that and the ability to access the children videos for my kids in my Amazon acct.The Freetime app is nice. Its simply clean. You set a password on the app and then at launch the app simply gives access to only which Apps, Videos and Books you choose. No browser although you can start a search and hit the Amazon page. There is no option for Music which makes both sense and no sense. It would be REALLY nice to see a Music option also and to allow the option to allow music by artist, album, song, etc just like you can sort with the amazon music store/player.Freetime Unlimited is a good start at something great. This is supposed to allow access to a slew of apps, videos and books geared towards children so as a parent we will feel safe with them accessing anything on the tablet (Freetime). Most of the content seems to be age appropriate but there were titles in the apps, games and videos I didn't want my children to access. My wife, who has a Masters Degree in Reading (I wont go on about her list of credentials but simply I am VERY proud of her) said some of the content wasn't age appropriate and/or had no educational value for the children. Keep in mind though, this is a new feature and it will most likely get better from here. I would like to see Music added though. I would like to be able to add music content by album, artist, song title, etc from my library. It would be nice to see content added along with the Unlimited plan like Imagination Movers, Fresh Beat Band, etc. that the kids could just play on their own. One thing that I have not been able to do is to delete content included in Unlimited, or at least disable it from being seen. This would be a work around (not a solution) for the content we don't want our children to be exposed to.This is something extra for Amazon to read. If we put in our children's ages I really think the content should be geared towards that age group. Its nice to have some fun material too but if a child is given this device as a pacifier then wouldn't it be nice for them to be able to actually practice things they should be working on in their age group? My wife would be a great addition to your team to help you determine what titles are age appropriate, its what she does for a living :-)About the wireless in Freetime. It seems to have a hard time moving from one network to another sometimes. I think it should connect flawlessly just like a regular tablet does or maybe its just how the Kindle Fire series handles moving from one network to another. Sometimes it says it needs to login and it brings up the Amazon site. It would be REALLY nice if this could be scripted to to be done in the background for Freetime so trusted networks will automatically connect without user (children) interaction.I ordered the \"power block\", a HDMI cable, an Amazon Basics bag for the kids to keep their tablets in and the Marware case (it was a hard choice between the Amazon case but this one was a bit cheaper although has less features). They love them, I strongly suggest getting the Amazon Basics bag. I installed Zagg's standard shield (i hear the HD shields are thinner and not as good). The shields look great and you cant tell they are there when your looking at them. I install these shields on everything, even on gorilla glass devices. It gives a good feel, less mess from oily fingers in my opinion and you don't cringe everything the device rubs across a scratchy surface. Well worth the money.Bottom line is the Kindle Fire HD 7\" is a great purchase for my children. It has been a bit of an expensive but a worthwhile investment. The Freetime Unlimited app has proven to be a great investment also. If you don't see the books, games, videos you want your child to have then you can simply purchase the content and give them access to it on a per item basis. I ordered a camera app for them to play with it, they love to record themselves making funny faces and noises."}, {"review_id": "2dcddb432c83469e18c69cd724b4e3fb", "review": "I bought this Samsung after a lot of thinking about maybe getting a new Kindle HD where the Samsung seemed to be a little better and after few days of use here is my thoughts:Comparisons between Samsung Tab and Kindle Fire HD:1- Kindle has a better and friendlier User Interface than the Samsung, specially for Novices and Kids. Easier Navigation and switching between apps.2- Kindle has a more sensitive and receptive touchscreen, it seems that I have to push the screen several times sometimes for the Samsung to respond.3- Samsung have a better App Store(Google) compared to the Amazon.4- Samsung can have a SD drive added.5- Samsung has back and Front Camera, Kindle just front.6- Samsung has less memory(8GB, 4.5 usable), Kindle starts with 16GB.7- Kindle processor is 1.2G while the Samsung is only 1GHz.8- Samsung seems to get a little sluggish at times specially when opening several apps in a row where never had that issue with the kindle, maybe because the kindle will not allow apps to continue running in background after closing them.9- Seems that the battery life is a little better with the Kindle.10- Kindle does not come with a charger(Ridiculous!) and alot of complaints of ads while using Kindle.11- Amazon customer service is superb, I don't think anyone beats them.12- Samsung has GPS, not the kindle.13- Kindle has hDMI output, not the Samsung.14- Samsung measured usable Ram is around 700MB and not 1GB.15- Same Price.16- Amazon Video Library and access is great, Parental control is great. Don't think Samsung has a Parental control and still haven't used their video library and to see if u can download bought movies to watch later?!17- Samsung options and settings are more versatile and editable for the experienced than the Kindle.So far, Seems the Kindle might have been a better option but not sure, I'll keep the Samsung for now and update this review as things change."}, {"review_id": "251201bfccc0b3a6c3a5a2444a508a3c", "review": "The build quality on this thing is AMAZING!

I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed."}, {"review_id": "064bd862bde3d944b652e962b7aeeed4", "review": "I bought the Kindle HD for its new features, replacing my Kindle Fire.

They should have put it in an easier spot to get to and see.The other thing is also the lack of Google Play apps.  There are many on there I want that are not available.  Some other reviewer said there is a way to get them.  I have not tried figuring that out yet.Besides those two things I have no other complaints.  Obviously because it is a tablet the battery does go down faster if you are using it for other things than just reading.  Another thing to consider is it is heavy because of all the features it has.  So its not as easy to carry around or stick in a pocket or purse like a stand-alone ereader would do.  So that is something to consider.It has great functions and great picture quality.  It also has a camera and you can skype.  You can check your email, download available apps, play games, listen to music read,surf, etc.  There are many many other functions.As far as reading goes you can buy Amazon books right on the reader or online through your account or purchase gift cards available in most stores where the gift cards are; I see them everywhere.  However, I never buy books.  I read many books a month and get them all free through the Overdrive program including latest releases.  I downloaded the app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can read Kindle format books and if I want to read non-Kindle format books I can read them on the ereader that is built into the Overdrive program, which is their console so I can read Kindle and Epub formats right on my Kindle Fire HD.  The ereader function of the Kindle Fire is very good.  The screen is bright, not much glare at all, tap to turn pages, easy dictionary access, bookmarking etc functions.  I also like how secure it is.  I have placed a password on it.  Its very easy to figure out and use.UPDATE:  I bought the ihome alarm/clock charger for this on Amazon.  See my review.  Its great. Its an alarm clock, charger (charges our KF and phones) and is a speaker for your KF for listening to music apps like Pandora, the FM radio the clock comes with etc."}, {"review_id": "2fc0afc4e6ae083c1d344af2803f0c74", "review": "First, let me say that I am an avid Kindle user and have been from the days of Kindle 1. Over the years since the first Kindle, I have purchased vast quantities of Kindle books. Currently, I own 5 Kindles (6 with the Fire HD). They are: the Kindle 1 (by far the best display of all the later e-ink kindles with an SD card slot and a user replaceable battery, which later editions omitted), returned a Kindle 2 for display issues, kept a Kindle 3 (Keyboard), own 2 Kindle touches, the original Fire, and now the Fire HD. All are used by my family. So when I ordered the KF-HD it was with high expectations of really wanting to love this thing. I use the original Fire all the time and love it. Here's what I found about the new Kindle Fire HD:Out of the box the hardware is impressive to say the least, and having used it extensively since receiving it, I find it this Kindle has too many problems to justify keeping the unit until they fix some MAJOR engineering mistakes and software inadequacies that are embarrassingly idiotic. The first Kindle Fire works great. This one, well, leaves much to be desired. Here are the Pros and Cons, as I have experienced them:Pros:1. Fantastic sound with the Dolby turned on. If this feature is off, the speakers sound worse than the original Kindle Fire. You can get this same sound on the original Kindle Fire using good external speakers or a good set of headphones.2. Whispersync with Voice (concurrent with a very big con, see below).3. Text to Speech.4. Very crisp and clear display (with a concurrent con, see below).Cons:1. The HD video display when viewing videos is either slightly on the orange to green side for skin tones (as compared to the original KF). The original Kindle Fire had much more realistic flesh tones on videos. All videos, at least in my opinion.2. The power cable attaches to the side of the unit, rather than at the top or bottom, making it impossible to charge and watch or read anything in landscape mode while charging. This is a major inconvenience. Given a choice between an HDMI cable output and a charging indicator, give me a charging indicator and let the Cloud do its job so it's unnecessary to plug in the Fire to a TV.3. No charging indicator light. How basic is this?? All other Kindle's have indicator lights! Was this an oversight? Or,engineering stupidity at it's best...you decide.4. Power switch and volume control are flush with the casing, impossible to see and/or find in the dark-unless you turn the unit on its side and push til you find a switch.5. Consistently has problems connecting with a wireless connection, giving the error of \"authentication failure\", making it necessary to connect using the \"Settings, Wireless, Connect\" from the settings menu (works fine after that).6. Whispersync for Voice and Audible.com do not communicate well at all! I bought several books (free) with free associated audio books from audible.com. What a nightmare! Audible.com does not automatically link your Amazon account, and when it does, it picks the first 3 devices to use on your account there. If the first 3 do not list your kindle fire HD, you cannot download the books wirelessly to your device from Amazon's Manage Your Kindle page or Audible.com's My Library page. Further, unless you deregister your device and then re-register it, you cannot change the order of the availability of your devices. However, when you do download the book and follow the link for \"professional narration\", it will link in for a purchase. You must then open your book in the Kindle Fire HD, and touch the bottom of the screen on the Chapter 1 page (beginning of book) for it to first download a sample audio, and then the purchased audio from Audible.com. MAJOR HASSLE. Without seamless integration of these two services, Kindle books and Audible.com, it becomes a big frustration very quickly. Did I mention that Audible.com charges $14.95 PER MONTH for membership? Not user friendly in a recession/depression environment! How about a \"no strings attached\" membership? Finally, Audible.com only permits 3 Kindle devices to be on your account. For my household, with 6 Kindles, this doesn't beget customer satisfaction, or a desire to become a member of Audible.com.Additionally, some of the free books linked to Whispersync for Voice I had previously purchased. Unfortunately, those editions would not link to Whispersync for Voice, meaning I had to re-purchase (albeit free) the book (different edition) to link to and then purchase (again with a free promotion) the audio book from Audible.com. For a paid version of a Kindle book that also has an audible version available but no link to Whispersync (those links are listed on the book product page) means you have to use a particular Kindle book with the particular companion Audible.com audible book. Bummer.7. Ads. Ads. Ads. For $199 I expect an Ad-free environment. Not here! You have to \"opt-out\" for an additional charge ($15). BAD MOVE for Amazon. Even then, once you opt-out, the continual \"suggestions\" are annoying and intrusive to the extreme. This does not exist on the original Kindle Fire.8. No SD card slot, a continuing Amazon deficiency (especially when dealing with content when you are out of Wi-Fi range), and no user replaceable battery. This is where my Kindle 1 shines. I keep categories of books on different SD cards because (obviously) the drive in K1 is inadequate to the task of taking my entire library along. The Kindle Keyboard (4 GB storage) houses my complete library, but not the Kindle Touch (2GB storage). You may ask, why is this important with the cloud drive available? Because ever since Amazon ripped my paid-for copy of George Orwell's 1984 off my Kindle without my permission, I do not trust my purchased content exclusively to Amazon's cloud drive. I back it up immediately to the computer.9. No Favorites section below the Carousel without going through the \"Favorites\" Star icon. Great when you can find it, annoying when you can't.10. Inconsistent displays on the Carousel. Not all items are displayed, they mysteriously disappear and reappear. When you tap them to open sometimes they do, and other times they just shake in place without opening. Other times, when trying to remove them from the Carousel, once you \"tap and hold\", the concurrent menu allowing you to remove the item from the device, the carousel or add/remove from Favorites does not appear at all. The \"shimmy\" effect of a vibrating icon on the Carousel is very disturbing (at least to me), making me wonder if it's trying to crash (aka a computer crash).12. No YouTube. No YouTube app that works.13. Email display is horrific both in portrait and landscape modes. Once an email is opened you have to scroll to read side-to-side, with a column list of your emails on the left (in landscape mode) which cannot be changed.14. Android Apps for Kindle Fire purchased for the original Kindle Fire may or may not (mostly not) work on the new Kindle Fire HD. When I asked about this, Customer Service told me they were \"working on it.\" Right out of the box this is inexcusable. It's like saying, \"You can't have all your Kindle books which you purchased on this device because it is not going to work yet for those items\".15. Huge screen glare problem. Just gotta love seeing my face and the room around me while doing anything with this Kindle! The \"anti-glare screen protector\" recommended by Amazon is anything but anti-glare, and (conveniently) no other anti-glare screen protectors offered will fit the KFHD.16. The \"recommended\" case by Amazon only allows the KF to be installed one way and the display to face one way when using the stand, so you can't watch a movie even if you flip it over to view a movie in landscape mode while charging. Unfortunately, due to the location of the power cable (when plugged in), this makes it impossible to watch a movie using the case as a stand while the power cord is plugged in. The stand use of the case is unstable. If you read in bed, as I do, I find this to be a massive problem. The RooCase for the Original Kindle Fire accomplished both tasks for the original KF nicely.17. Camera only works with Skype (and Facebook with a lot of fiddling with an app to make it happen).My advice is PASS ON THIS PURCHASE. WAIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HD 3. Mine is going back, and I would advise anyone wanting a Kindle Fire to buy a refurbished original KF from Amazon (if any) or go to eBay. This one is too expensive and too buggy--perhaps released too quickly before fixing engineering and software glitches. For me, the Cons far outweighed the Pros to the point that this device is not for me. Hopefully my observations will help someone in their purchase decision. I really did want to keep this device; however, given the financial times and the inherent problems I have experienced with the KFHD, it is not worth the effort if you already have a Kindle Fire Original.Finally, given the above, I could not also justify buying an 8.9\" screen for the larger KFHD either. Buy an iPad instead if you want a bigger screen and easy email handling (yes, I have and use an iPad).For the convenience, I hope one day Amazon adds Text to Speech to the original KF, but til then my Kindle Keyboard keeps on keepin' on. Fine for me. The newer editions are (for me) a waste of time and money.REVIEW UPDATE:Even though I sent mine back, I decided to try one more time because I got a new one as gift. Because of continuing hardware problems, I am now on my 5th return of this item to Amazon (LOVE their customer service) by their request. KFHD #6 still has issues which cannot be resolved.NOTE WELL: MY REVIEW IS A COMPARISON OF THE NEW KFHD TO THE 1ST GEN KINDLE FIRE ONLY. Several comments to my review have been rude and mean, which has kept me from updating this review until now (Jan 2013).My 6th KFHD has solved the video color problem very well, but the previous 1,2,3,4,5 ones had speakers blow out when connected to a bluetooth device (ipod classic and an ipod touch). Bummer. I have not connected this one to a bluetooth speaker (Bose), nor will I in the future.STILL have email problems. Started using the paid email app which approximates the display of the amazon email app on the original KF. However, my ISP uses a Barracuda Spam Firewall Filter that sends an email for me to connect to my quarantined inbox to check if any emails need to go to the inbox rather than the quarantine box. The Barracuda link goes to a web page, but the web page only loads half-way and will NOT allow me to access the quarantine inbox. The old KF had no problem with this. None. The new one does not allow this function. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A BROWSER GLITCH ON THEIR PART AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FIXING IT. 3 customer service agents have told me it is a known issue that Amazon will NOT solve. End of discussion. So if your ISP uses Barracuda, BEWARE.AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL FIRE, THIS ONE IS STILL A DISAPPOINTMENT for me. As for you, only you can decide."}, {"review_id": "e354e60a1e03b7198912535b4539c04a", "review": "Let me begin this by saying that I used to be an \"early adopter\".  I had to have it when it first came out.  I've stopped doing that, but in this case I wish I had bought the first Fire.  From using a friend's I was excited when they finally announced the second gen devices.  The original was simple to use and did most things I wanted it to.  This one is incredibly hard to figure out, even with years of techy experience and is more limited in its use.PROS -Feels solid and well built.Anti-glare screen is nice, and the screen is vibrant.  It's not Retina, but then it didn't cost like one so I'm OK with that.Some have reported it being slow and unresponsive, but I haven't had much of a problem except when in apps I know have problems from them doing the same to my phone.  Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like \"charm\" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I'll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn't negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can't close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn't a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn't use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone's Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn't really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don't mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It's clear Amazon doesn't want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn't belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don't use like HBO and Showtime aren't there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can't access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle's \"special\" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn't tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a \"purchase\" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don't know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don't want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven't found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I'm not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren't going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it's pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven't decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It's a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon's watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.  I haven't tested the HDMI out yet, since my micro-HDMI cable hasn't arrived yet.  Will update this review next week when I get that."}, {"review_id": "80ea0ac23997d1bbd0f4057ed86307c9", "review": "I'm a longtime Kindle owner, starting with the Kindle 3, and then Kindle Fire.  I recently bought my wife a Kindle Fire HD for her birthday, and was blown away at the upgrade in quality from the Kindle Fire to the HD (and let me emphasize that I LOVE my old Kindle Fire) ... it's just in a different league.  The vaunted audio improvements are not just marketing hype; it was amazing the first time hearing \"surround sound\" coming from a 7-inch tablet.  And the picture quality is awesome.  Also side-by-side, the Wi-Fi performance is improved.  For Amazon Prime and Instant Video customers, it's been an issue before that if you own an HD video, you could still only see it in standard definition on the older device, even if you could get it on HD on your smart TV hookup.  You can now see the full HD on the Fire, enhanced by the new sound.

I can access my movies on the Fire or my Roku. The fire will also play to your TV via HDMI.I listen to several podcast each week, all at no-charge. I also enjoy the linking of audio books with the e-book. While driving, I can listen to an audio book or music.

All excellent products but not getting any use since I bought the Fire HD.It's all a matter of what is the right fit. They're all amazing products. This is not a subsitute for a small laptop if you're a student. It is a great portable media device that gives you access to a wealth of free or inexpensive content.I was very surprised the lack of 3G did not bother me. The large storage capacity made it a non-issue for the most part. I just load it up with content and use my smart phone for email. Of course many smartphones can be used as a wi-fi hot spot.Amazon has a generous trial period, give it a try.By the way, I'm also happy with the Amazon Kindle Fire cover.

I really struggled with which tablet to get for her. Yes she is 8 and its an extream gift, but we knew she would use it and take care of it. The tablet is made really well with a great feel to it. If it wasnt for an 8 year old i would not have bought a case for it, it just has that good of a feel to it.  I chose this tablet because it was for a child and i know there is only so much she would need it for. Mostly entertainment. Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old.  My daughter has also done more reading on this tablet in a week then she ever has, so its been very good for her on that end as well."}, {"review_id": "151c45959db26e28c40bcf01d297771c", "review": "I was an early adopter of the original Kindle Fire in November 2011. I loved the Fire, but it was a bit clunky in some tasks, and it sadly lacked some desirable hardware features. I'm happy to say that I've had my Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, and my initial impressions are very positive. Clearly, Amazon listened to customers and addressed many of their comments. For starters:1. There's an external volume control. This was my single biggest gripe with the original Fire.2. There's a built-in microphone. That means you can Skype and use cool apps like Soundhound and Shazam. With the front-facing camera, you can do video Skyping, which is a big plus. The lack of a microphone or mic input was my second biggest gripe with the original Fire.3. An HDMI port means you can connect your Fire HD directly to most TV sets. I have a Roku, so that's not as big of a deal to me, but the HDMI puts the Fire HD out in front of almost every other tablet. I definitely want to try streaming Amazon instant video to a hotel TV the next time I travel.4. The video is noticeably crisper for videos.5. Bluetooth is a great new feature. It opens the possibility of wirelessly connecting the Fire HD to a myriad of products. I've been using a small, portable Bluetooth speaker to amplify my original Fire's sound. That works, but only with a cable connecting the Fire and the speaker. With the Fire HD, it only took a minute to activate the Bluetooth, find the speaker, and pair it with the Fire HD.6. The sound quality is very noticeably better. So far I haven't encountered an MP3 or video where I had to strain to hear, and oftentimes I'm having to back down on the volume.7. The web browser appears to be a little faster, although I won't really know how much faster until I upgrade my wireless router to a newer, dual band model. The wi-fi reception is quite good. When I connected the HD to our home network, the HD detected ten other networks in near-by houses, which is more than our laptop PC can detect.8. In the original Fire, using the graphic handles to select text was awkward and not always very responsive, especially with text in emails. The HD appears to have improved considerably the ease of selecting text.9. Unlike the original Fire, the memory is not partitioned, so it appears you can use all the user-available memory (12.63 GB) for anything - books, video, music, photos, etc. This is a big improvement.10. The virtual keyboard has been restored to something closer to the original Fire. Once again, there are separate periods and commas, so you don't have to hold down the period to type a comma. This was a real improvement.11. Text-to-Speech for books has returned to the HD. There aren't any settings - the voice is either on or off, and there's only a female voice - but it sounds more like a human voice and less like a computer than before.The HD was delivered already registered to me, so about all I had to do was connect with my wi-fi, set up my Gmail account (less than one minute) and set my favorites for the web browser, then download some of my books, magazines, videos, and apps from the Cloud. With 8GB of memory in the original Fire, I often had to delete apps before downloading any new apps. With 16GB in the Fire HD, that's much less critical.Because the size is different and the controls and ports have been moved around, cases for the original Kindle Fire won't work. The padded envelope sleeve that I had for the original Kindle Fire does work, although it's not a perfect fit.One annoyance: the Kindle Fire HD displays color advertisements on its lock screen, so every time you turn on the HD, you see advertisements for a Kindle e-book, a video, Amazon MP3 music, and such. Amazon has announced that owners can opt-out of the ads for $15. After using the HD for a few days, if the ads are too annoying, I may opt-out. Update: Apparently only the rotating lock screen ads can be removed by opting out. The targeted \"suggestions\" that show up when you're in the Amazon Store won't go away, so I don't know if it's worth $15 to opt-out. You'll have to decide that. You can do this at any time from your \"Manage My Kindle\" page.Invariably, the Kindle Fire HD is going to be compared to the Nexus 7, its closest competition in size, performance, and price. The HD weighs 13.9 oz. vs. 12 oz. for the Nexus (the original Fire weighed 14.6 oz.). That weight difference is at least partially offset by longer claimed battery life: 11 hours for the HD vs. 8 hours for the Nexus. Screen resolution is 1280x800 for both tablets (the original Fire's resolution was 1024x600). Most of the new features of the HD, like the front-facing camera and the microphone, are common to both tablets, but the HDMI port on the HD is a very nice feature that the Nexus can't match. I've used a Nexus 7, and it's a wonderful tablet, but based on my initial impressions, my slight favorite is the Kindle Fire HD, mainly for its ability to stream Amazon instant videos (which the Nexus can't, at least not without some finagling).Overall, the HD appears to be a worthy successor to the original Kindle Fire.-------------------------------------------Update (September 15, 2012):* At first, the layout of the various screens is somewhat different from the original Fire, but after playing around for a while, I'm getting used to it, and learning how everything works is pretty intuitive.* I'm reading on forums that some folks are having problems running some of the apps they had on the original Kindle Fire. For example, I'm having problems with MapQuest - it starts up, but crashes within a minute or so. It's probably just some glitches that will be fixed with the first OS upgrade.* The power button and volume control switch are flush with the case. It's not a big deal, but I wish they stuck out a millimeter or so to make it easier to feel them.* The original Fire was noticeably rectangular, so I used it mostly in the portrait position. The HD is more square, and it seems more natural to use it in the landscape position."}, {"review_id": "b028ba1b35489abd5b85d1e8a2289bbf", "review": "Overall very pleased with the Kindle Fire HD.

I think that aspect of it is great.There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.It does not have the basic card reader.

You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.Update: Sept 18, 2013I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer."}, {"review_id": "fc5d44724351d3e83dc2fb22ae0611ea", "review": "Kindle Fire HD 7\"Having been an Android and iOS user for the past few years (iPod Touch, iPhone, Motorola Droid2, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kindle Touch, Motorola MotoACTV), I've been anxious to try a Kindle Fire. Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7\" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7\" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9\" or a 10\" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7\" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9\" is best for reading magazines but the 7\" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...)"}, {"review_id": "0ec5dfd7590bde7db237a9f2c83b27f6", "review": "I bought this Kindle fire for my 6 years old daughter.  She likes it but she wishes it was white or have a choice of color to choose from.  The power buttons and volume button are camouflage and hard to find even on daylight.  They should have made the buttons a different color.  The sound quality are great compare to my Ipad.  The picture quality are comparable to the Ipad.  One annoying thing is that the Wi-Fi keeps dropping when you're not using it for a few days.  When I used it to download apps it could not find my WI-FI network and I have to go into the WI-FI setting to turn it off and on again to make it work.  I called Amazon customer service and they told me to me to do the same thing.  It is annoying because it should memorized your network and you don't have to login every time you're using the internet.  Anyway I did not want to return it for this problem because my daughter does not go online and I only go to download apps for her."}, {"review_id": "3739b8e19c3e9d9708ebdf1d7f67b1bf", "review": "I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she just loves it. The video quality of the HD is awesome."}, {"review_id": "279d1f06f03ffa9a219c519e441ae23a", "review": "This is my first Fire, so please bear in mind that I cannot contrast/compare to the Kindle Fire (traditional). I have numerous other Kindle e-readers, and work with numerous other Android and Apple tablets on a regular basis.First impressions - when it arrived today, it looked very sleek. Well-packaged, easy-to-open (unlike reports of the Nexus 7). No power plug, but I have it charging as I write this using a standard USB charging kit. Please note that if you plan on charging this device, you will (preferably) need a USB power adapter that supplies a full 2 Amps of current (or better). Otherwise, the unit will take forever to charge. And by forever, you can just check the FireHD's site out - 13 hours. Yeah. More than all night. No thanks. :) I personally believe that not including such an adapter was a wise cost-cutting move on Amazon's part... many of us already have a 2A charging adapter from other tablets/etc, and it cut $10 off the cost of the unit (or $20, if you didn't buy Amazon's special charger when you ordered the FireHD). By the way, my particular FireHD came charged to 68%.The size is perfect - it's got a good, solid feel, as well. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to let you know it's not a toy. The back is a nicely-textured matte finish. I don't like larger tablets that much, since it obviates one of the major advantages of a tablet in the first place (mobility). At iPad/Transformer sizes, I start to wonder why the person didn't just have a Netbook or regular laptop.Setup: The FireHD comes, as all first-bought Kindles should, pre-registered to your Amazon.com account. After power-on, the device asks for a wireless network, a timezone, and (optionally) Facebook/Twitter integration. That's it. Then it gets to the carousel/shelf interface and is instantly linked to your account's purchases. All my latest books, music, and videos were there, even those purchased earlier today, along with a Kindle Fire Welcome Guide. The device automatically updated itself after the first sleep I put it in.Incidentally, before the device arrived, I had pre-registered to remove the ads, for $15. From what I have heard on other Kindles, the ads are actually not very invasive or annoying, and actually can help pay for the Kindle over time through reduced prices or coupon offers. Me, I prefer an uncluttered and un-advertised-to interface, so I opted out. I think it was absolutely excellent of Amazon to offer this option in response to those who wanted out of that, but I would have been fine with them being there if there was no option to turn them off.Screen: The screen is gorgeous. Here, Amazon has learned from its competitors, who on their tablets used an application where the LCD panel is laminated/applied directly to the back of the cover glass. This allows the FireHD to have a clear, crisp screen no matter what the viewing angle. When I first powered the unit on, I cringed for a few seconds because it felt like the screen was too small - like I would feel cramped. This, however, was absolutely not the case, once the Kindle was active and into all the content, it was very open and inviting. I can only imagine how big the 8.9\" would be!In terms of usability for the touch-like nature of the display, this is the best tablet thus far I have ever used. Even light presses register properly. Many other tablets I've used are very particular about how hard you need to press or linger before registering. And yet, even with the \"hyper-sensitivity\" this device has, I have yet to have it register anything false (wrong button pushes), which are another hallmark of other tablets. Bravo, Amazon.Apps: The fire comes pre-loaded with OfficeSuite (a free version of a larger suite for editing documents), the Silk web browser, a Calendar, and various other supporting apps for things like Email, Contacts, IMDB, and Help. I like that they kept the initial load relatively free of bloatware (MOTOROLA: TAKE A HINT PLEASE!!!). I personally do not like the lack of some applications on the Amazon App Store... for instance, I would have liked to load Firefox or Chrome, but they are not there. Also, a link for Skype is on there but the app is not pre-loaded.Books read well on this, and this being my first Fire, I like the interface for reading books, though I definitely prefer e-readers for eyestrain reasons. It's nice that the FireHD has text-to-speech, especially since the PaperWhite lost this functionality (which I think was a great move; that device is an e-READER, not e-audibleprovider). The three backgrounds should help users with some of the eyestrain for limited periods of reading.I have not yet connected this to my corporate Exchange servers, and quite honestly I may not bother. But it's nice to know that's an option. Email for Gmail works well, with an occasional \"stutter\" to the interface while it's loading something from the web (see my comment in the next paragraph for Performance). I doubt I will do much email from this device, but again, it's nice to know that it's there, in a pinch.Performance: The processor is fast. It's not perfectly smooth, but reasonable. The vast majority of the lag, from what I have seen, revolves around network operations. Basically, if a screen has to load an image, or some other content, from the Internet or Amazon, the device can, and will, \"stutter\" occasionally. I guess there could be adjustments done to the interface to avoid this, but the fact is that to me, it isn't distracting from the experience. Temple Run and various other games run very smoothly on the device. I know it's about to sound harsh, but I would expect nothing less from an Android 4.0-based device. :)The storage (I got the 16GB version) is adequate for what I will use it for - mostly media streaming from the Web, plus some locally installed apps, games, and side-loaded books. Anything else will be on the Cloud. If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is \"up\" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to \"feel\" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which \"announces\" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for \"lower volume\", larger nubbin for \"increase volume\"). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.Here's where the \"religious war\" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of \"this one is best.\" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon \"get\" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a \"master\" as opposed to a \"master of none\" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.Conclusions:I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for. We should be looking at a device that provides easy, mobile access to an ecosystem of rich media, with features and accessibility that make it easy to use and enjoy. The Amazon ecosystem is amazing - having been a Kindle e-reader user for years, and now a Prime member with all the media perks that entails, I love how the media I purchase is available anywhere, on any platform. I think this device is a perfect complement to that experience; especially with the HDMI-out and Bluetooth capabilities, which allow this device to be a multimedia powerhouse at home or on the road.The only \"downsides\" I see in this device are the slightly-difficult-to-address buttons, the lack of an option to remove/disable the carousel, a Collections for Books feature (after 100 books, it's tough sometimes to organize things and find what you want to read), and the ability to set a custom screen background while on sleep. Since three of these four are software-based, I'm hoping they can be addressed in future software. In the meantime, these do not significantly impact my enjoyment of my device.Anyone seriously considering a tablet, especially one that takes full advantage of the Amazon ecosystem, should be considering this device. It is solid, performs well, and has a rich set of features that a $199 price tag makes all the more amazing. I think that, for $200, you would be hard-pressed to find a better way of enjoying Amazon's content offerings.(By the way, after finishing the typing of this review, the device is at 92%, which is awesome charging speed. It's great, again, that Amazon doesn't force you to use their chargers, unlike SOME OTHER manufacturers. :))"}, {"review_id": "c687cef56ac10872ef5d0ae0869650db", "review": "I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not $500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen? The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the $200 price tag. I might pay the $15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me. If it crashes, then I just tap it again and it works. I've also watched a few movies using the built in player as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime. No crashes for me at all. I'm sure OS stability will be improved as time goes on.OVERALL SATISFACTIONCompared to my iPad 3, obviously the Fire HD is not as \"good\" so to speak. I mainly got it because I wanted something smaller. I also mainly used the iPad to surf the web, watch videos, and play some simple games. The Fire HD accomplishes this and does so much more. If you are expecting an iPad killer, or a desktop replacement, or a productivity machine, then you should look elsewhere.I bought this to be a media device, and I believe that is what Amazon meant this to be. In this regard, I think this is a great device. In fact, I decided to keep this and sell my iPad 3, which will give me another $200+ to spend on other things. Just remember, this device is not for everyone. If you want a media device, you will be happy with this. Do not expect an iPad for $200.UPDATE 9/18/12Just wanted to add a few more things I have noticed over the past 24 hours.- Power/Volume Buttons: There are a bit hard to press, which is somewhat alleviated by having the official case. Maybe it's because I'm a longtime iPad user, but this will definitely take some getting used to.- Screen Glare: It took me a little while to notice, but I was playing a Seek & Find game while on Caltrain, with the bright Palo Alto sun shining right on me, and didn't have any trouble seeing the screen. I remembered that Amazon mentioned how the screen was changed to reduce glare, and they did an amazing job.UPDATE 9/20/12Two days later and I am still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts from me:BATTERY LIFEI have been playing Enigmatis (a hidden object game) for about an hour and a half each day on my commute. This drains about 15 - 20% of the battery with the screen brightness almost at the highest setting. Again, not iPad gold standard, but still very good.SYNCING MUSICI have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and used an app called Easy Phone Transfer to get all my music from iTunes onto the phone. It transferred everything, including album covers, and I was hoping to find something like that for this device. I tried iSyncr, a $3 app, which did the job, but did not sync over album covers. I uploaded all my music into the Cloud, then downloaded it from Amazon, which increased the audio quality for a lot of my songs and added artwork, but this still did not show up on the device.I got very frustrated getting all the album artwork over and eventually just gave up. It's not a big deal but I am kind of anal about those kinds of things. Just a heads up if anyone else out there is crazy about it like I am.UPDATE 09/21/12I got a call from Amazon Customer Service about this review, which surprised me very much. They advised me the best way to get the artwork to show up is have the songs in both the Cloud Player as well as the device, which I know does work fine. I was hoping to have the artwork show without needing things in the Cloud, but not a big deal any more.I am more impressed with the fact that Amazon called me to give me advice on how to remedy the situation and ask if there were any other questions I had on the Kindle. The representative said he wanted to make sure I was happy with the Fire HD. This is one of the big reasons I went with the Kindle, and with Amazon in general. I have had great experiences with their customer service, who have always been able to handle my issues quickly and efficiently. No need to set up an appointment days later with a wannabe IT guy with a hugely overstated job title.So this update is not really for the device itself, but sometimes it's not just the device, it's the company that offers it that makes a difference. This is why I no longer have any Apple devices, as cool as they may be. But it's not 100% gravy, as I have noticed lately that the keyboard keeps popping up randomly on screens where there is nowhere to enter text, ie. while playing a game. I just have to press the Back arrow to get rid of it, but maybe a bug the Amazon engineers want to take a look at.UPDATE 10/05/12So I don't know if it was always there, but over this past weekend I noticed a dead pixel on my Kindle's screen. I called Kindle Support and after a short 5 minute call, they sent me a new Kindle, no questions asked. So once again, very happy with Amazon customer service. I am still very happy with the device, and have some more thoughts on it:HDMI CONNECTIONI bought an HDMI cable to hook up the Fire to my 46\" Samsung and was quite impressed with the results. The quality was very good, not Bluray quality of course, but better than SDTV on an HD screen. You actually see every single thing you do on the big screen, like you are using a giant Kindle.GOOGLE PLAY APPSOne of the main drawbacks in my opinion is, or should I say was, the lack of all the Google Play apps available on the Kindle. With a little research, I found out how to add apps that are not available in the Amazon store. It is pretty easy to do and works very well with the apps I tried. This greatly improves my opinion of the Fire HD.PLASTIC AROUND THE SCREENThe outer most edges of the Kindle are plastic. I noticed some kind of discoloration on the corner of mine, and just thought it was some dirt to scratch off. So I rubbed my thumb nail on the area, and noticed there were visible marks on the plastic. It appears this plastic can scratch some what easily, but I think this is just cosmetic as not of the plastic actually flaked. If you are not very anal about how your stuff looks, you probably won't notice it.OS CHANGESHere are two small gripes I have with the OS that I'm sure could be fixed with an OS update:- Battery Meter: It would be nice if the battery meter could show percentage instead of just a graphic bar. Some people have mentioned Battery HD, but you still have to swipe down to see the percentage, so this makes it easier but does not solve the issue I had.- Personal Videos: The mp4 videos I put on the device are located in the \"Personal Videos\" app, which shows screen shots of all the videos I put in. The problem is, all that is shown are the screen shots. You can get more info by holding your finger down on each video, but when you have multiple seasons of a show on the Kindle, it can get confusing. Ideally we should be able to look at videos in a list like our music.UPDATE 11/15/12Still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts:LEFT HAND MODEI did't think this would be a problem until I played a Solitaire game that DID have a left-handed mode. As a lefty who usually uses the Fire in landscape, I often have to reach across the screen to access the Settings or Home button in the menu. It's a small grievance, but can be really annoying when watching a movie or reading something. If there was an option for a left-handed layout with the menus on the left side of the device, that would be great.PERSONAL VIDEOS APPI had earlier complained about this app, as it did not list my movies and crashed playing a pair of them. I recently drove down to LA from SF, and put 5 movies on device, only to find that 4 of them would not play! I was pretty mad, until I remembered a simple solution, download another app. I downloaded Avia Media Player, which is not the greatest either, but it played all the movies I put on the Kindle. My faith was restored.GOOGLE PLAY APPSA lot of people have asked how to do this. If you are not having luck with Google searches, try this:[...]"}, {"review_id": "cc32a70fce60d4a1c360d34082315fda", "review": "I had originally bought a Kindle Fire for my mom to read books when she went on vacation. I played around with it for a week or two (loading it with eBooks and making sure I was familiar with it before handing it over) During the time I really enjoyed the device, but wasn't sure I had enough of a need to buy my own.In comes the Kindle Fire HD 7\" I happened to be at Best Buy checking them out when I realized that I do buy books quite frequently, and that I could use one. I took a few days to decide what device was best for me, and thanks to the people I work with I had a chance to compare the Kindle Fire HD and a Nexus 7 side by side.Comparison, Performance wise they are a very close match, I would say the Nexus is slightly faster over all. but not enough that it would matter in the end. my deciding factor was the Amazon experience. I wanted that User Interface, where I see what I am looking for as soon as I turn on the device. I did not want the  distractions of other games and apps to have the chance to prevent me from reading the books that I bought the tablet for. So I ended up getting the Kindle Fire at Best Buy a few days later.since I have picked up the Kindle Fire HD I have found that I use it to watch YouTube and Netflix a lot while cooking or being in the kitchen. I also take it with me where ever I go, I can get amazing Wifi signal when in the city. Thanks to the Dual-Band Wifi in this thing I get better signal than I do on my laptop. I find thanks to the Wifi Signal I tend to surf the internet more on my Kindle than my laptop.The Screen Is amazing as well. When watching Netflix or Amazon Prime the Videos look fantastic. I haven't tried loading videos on it to take with me on the Go, But i am sure the quality will be amazing just like Netflix or Prime.Also while watching movies the best thing about the Kindle Fire compared to any other tablet is the speakers. They are simply amazing. You get good quality sound without any distortion. and decent bass too. This is great when you are trying to watch videos and there are dogs barking in the background, or maybe  a car driving by you can still hear what you are watching and not have to deal with crackling or other interference from the speakers.I have shown this tablet to a few of my friends, and so far one has bought it (also loves it) and the other is still on the fence (but leaning toward the Kindle Fire HD)"}, {"review_id": "bc66bba4cf786e1433c105542f2189c8", "review": "I've used an e-reader since the Rocket ebook in 1999, and I've always believed I wanted only an ebook reader with no other features. I don't get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I've had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother's tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7\" is just perfect for me. It's light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it's fresh on my mind, and I'm reviewing everything I read.I didn't realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I've always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I've even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what's on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn't last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn't take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I've been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can't hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading. This won't be an issue for most people, but I wanted to mention it for those people who might have similar problems."}, {"review_id": "56a4da9f68e559f95209f150ed02c3b9", "review": "Video quality is exceedingly poor.

The backlit LCD is the worst reading experience I have ever had.I bought the device for the text to speech function removed from the regular kindles. But they killed it. It has a single female voice and the cadence is just weird. How am I suppose to get into sherlock holmes when Watson's voice is female?Moreover, the short cut or accessibility details should make the device easier to read... Well not if you have a child. I couldn't get through a single page without my 2-year son tapping the screen and skipping to the end of the book. This happened 30 times in a row regardless of what I did to guard the device. All my son needed to do was tap anywhere on the lower bar.If I had personal time I could read a book, you know with paper. I use the kindle because it can read to me while I play with my kids. Well the new kindle fire kills that experience. With the old school kindle the worst my son could do was stop playback. Than I could just push the space bar and restart it. Now he taps the screen nearly anywhere and I'm finished.

But having grown accustomed to my previous 7\" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality \"video card\" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard \"fabric\" that completely zips around unit and has no \"straps\" (Marware beige)Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7\" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast."}, {"review_id": "7607870df569e9b898445a1f4a73a36b", "review": "It's a great product, especially for the money.The GoodBattery life, totally useable for a full movie.Storage capacity.  32GB is a great point for the price.Speakers.Screen - bright, clear and HD resolutionHDMI outputWireless - REALLY good wireless antenna.

I agree with many of the accolades mentioned by other reviewers. The purpose of my review is to draw attention to the inability to increase the text size of text on web pages. The text of web pages is so small it is difficult or unpleasant to read. You can use the pinch zoom feature to increase the screen image and zoom in, but this so annoying when you are reading because you have to constantly scroll. Other Androd tablets and smartphones allow you to increase the text size on web pages. I have added a customer image of a side by side comparison of web pages with my smaller smartphone and the Kindle hd. The text on the smartphone is considerably larger and easier to read than on the Kindle. I often find myself reading the internet on my smartphone instead of my Kindle for this reason alone. Hopefully if this gets enough attention the developers will add the ability to increase text font size.

Not only that but getting all comfy under the covers with it is akin to the flashlight `forts' we used to make as kids. It is very easy to figure out, usable right out of the box and then, with apps, highly configurable if you are into that sort of thing which I am. The color is brilliantly crisp and clear and the audio is great although I have only listened to books on it so far, no music. I splurged on the leather cover - horrendously overpriced - and carry it with me in my purse everywhere I go.I do wish it had an app like the iPad one where you hold it up to the sky and see the constellations above you in real time but that is the only area of disappointment. There have been so many times when I am reading a book and just stop and wonder at what a truly marvelous device this is, how far we have come so quickly. I just finished a sequel to a book published a few years ago and thought when I read the first book it was a book, a book made out of paper and that, at that time, I had not envisioned I would be reading the sequel on such a magical device.So many of my friends, fellow retirees, still struggle with their computers and are baffled and helpless as soon as something goes wrong.

The main reason for me was HDMI although I would also like micro SD support.Web surfing is better but still no comparison to my desktop.The screen is significantly better than the original Fire. Colors are more accurate and the dynamic range is much much larger. Pictures are now more natural looking with a gradual transition from dark to bright, much closer to my calibrated monitor.I am not bothered by the ads, actually not sure where the ads are. No access to Google play is not a big deal for me. I only have a few apps loaded and that's all I need.Finally, I decided to stay with 7\" size. I just can't see to need to use a 10\" tablet. 7\" is just about right for carrying around and big enough to properly display everything I need. If I need larger display, I have multiple monitors and TVs to do that.Edit: May 12 2013 updateThe rating was changed from 4 stars to now 5 stars because of the two following findings1.

The main question you should ask yourself is do you shop or buy from amazon. If the answer is yes, buy it. If you don't, then buy something else. It's pretty much as easy as that. I don't understand all these people that buy the Fire HD to \"try it out\" and complain that it takes the Fire 4.5888888 seconds longer to load a screen than the nexus or ipad. Can you really not wait a total of 5 extra seconds for a device to load a page? I think if that is a deal breaker for you, perhaps you have bigger problems at hand. There is really nothing that I found that I can complain about with this tablet, I'm owned several kindles over the years and I loved the 1st fire which i recently sold once I ordered this one. Many people have already stated the improvements and I agree 100% with what other reviewers have said. This is my first Kindle also with the \"Ads\" on the device and I must say, it's not nearly as annoying as I had thought it was going to be. I also like the whole \"customers have also bought\" section on the home screen as it gives you other items that you may like. My book wish list is quickly filling up thanks to that tricky little feature. As others have said, the screen is amazing. Watching a film in HD, hell I think the picture is better than my 3 year old Toshiba HDTV. The built in speakers do sound better than any other speakers on any device I have heard, however I still mostly use headphones while watching movies or videos on it. Again, its a great device, there is nothing I can complain about here. The fact that for under $300 I have a HD tablet with case and charger is pretty much amazing.

The brillant colors and sounds through the Kindle is outstanding!  Just can't believe the price!One issue I have with this is having only one prime membership and two devices. My granddaughter can use any material that is in cloud (things that I may want to watch or read; but not age appropriate for her). I try to download my material to my device so I can remove it from Cloud. I tried to use the Kindle Free time feature; but I couldn't keep up with all the apps she is downloading; we only have the purchase parential control on as all of the controls are very restricted.

I waited to review it, because glitches and problems generally show up after the excitement has worn off.  I've had a couple of thoughts of \"I wish,\" but nothing that would make me lower my rating.  Here's what I like--and what I don't:This screen is absolutely beautiful.  I wanted it mostly for books, but videos and content are flawless on it.  The books are beautiful and crisp, too, with plenty of options to change brightness and color.  This cuts down on eye strain.  There is a glare, in bright sun.  This is worse than a regular kindle, but not as bad as most tablets.  I was expecting much worse, with the HD screen, so I've just put it down as the best possible at this time.I wanted this because I'm in college and constantly needing books.  It's faster, easier, and cheaper to download kindle books than to try to buy them in a physical copy, especially when I need  some of the more obscure titles for my classes.  I still have books that I want for myself in hardback form, but nothing beats kindle for college!The build is sturdy, but light.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it if I touch it, but it's comfortable to hold.A lot of people complain about not being able to get Google play content and try to find workarounds, but I don't need that, so it's not an issue for me.  I'd rather buy from Amazon, anyway.  Past experience has taught me that their customer service and quality is superior.  If you aren't like me and you want to be able to access absolutely everything in the world on one device, it might be a drawback.  For me, it's not a problem.  I haven't come across anything I need that Amazon doesn't offer--usually cheaper and/or better then the other guys.I am not very techno-savvy, so it's a plus for me that this device is easy and ready to use right out of the box.  I signed in to Amazon and had everything I've bought in the past at my fingertips.One MINOR drawback is the memory.  You'd think 16gb was enough, but it's only enough if you keep your content in the cloud.  That's fine, if you aren't traveling, but if you find yourself without wifi access you cannot get to your content.  I downloaded a season of a tv show, knowing I would be without wifi, and it really ate up the memory, slowing my kindle fire down a lot.  After watching, I removed the episodes from the device and the slowdown disappeared.  I found myself wishing for more memory, then.  Most of the time, though, I rely on the cloud and 16gb is fine.  I just have to remember that small limitation.  (If I were buying one, I'd go with the 32gb model, personally, and have a little more room to download content for the times I'll be without access.  This was a gift, so I cannot really complain.)  I love the cloud and use it for most things, anyway, so it's a minor issue.  The only time memory is a problem is when I'm traveling.  For some, that might be a bigger issue than it is for me, as it's a portable device.  On my daughter's tablet, which has expandable memory, we are able to download a lot more content and take it with us.  Entertainment is never out of reach, even without internet.  All in all, though, my kindle is easier to work, has a better screen, and is organized better.  Everything has drawbacks.I haven't found anything in the three weeks I've had my kindle fire that would make it anything less than a great value.  I definitely recommend this device.

It's served me well these past few years, but getting a Kindle Fire HD has opened up a bigger world of applications.For one thing, I can stream both Netflix and Pandora, which helps me on my personal and professional side projects quite a bit (I co-host several podcasts and radio shows based on entertainment like movies, books, and television).For another, I can finally take advantage of the electronic delivery of graphic novels, I feature I really love now that I've upgraded. The interface takes a few tries to get used to, as I'm a newbie to touchscreen interfaces, but it's pretty intuitive.It's also nice to have access to all of those casual gaming apps that most folks get on their smartphones. While Angry Birds has a somewhat limited appeal to me (I only got the Star Wars version), I'm really addicted to the Perry the Platypus game and look forward to trying out the Plants vs. Zombies port (I have the PC version and want to try out the tablet one).Now, I do have a few complaints, but none of them are big enough to drop it down from 5 stars.First, sometimes the typing interface and autocorrect can be glitchy. I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire...

I rooted and then installed the android operating system; it kind of liberated the tablet. It was more responsive, but development of the community was slow because the touchpad was not that popular. Reading on the tablet was really good, but forget about reading in your bed this thing was heavy.  So I decided to sell the HP touchpad. Decided that I was either going to go for the kindle fire HD or nexus 7. I looked at both devices and I was impressed with the performance of both. But the nexus 7 was king in performance.  But what I really disliked was the screen and the storage space of the nexus 7.  So I knew I was going to use the tablet to the maximum so I went with the kindle fire hd because it offered more space. As it is now I only have 6.78 GB left after everything I have done to the tablet.Kindle fire HD \"7\" The reason why I rooted===================================I ended up rooting my kindle fire.  There are tutorials on YouTube and xda developers.  I always like rooting the cell phones and tablets I get my hands on. My hd2 was rooted so many times (rip hd2 best cell phone ever). If could I would root my ti-89 titanium.  So I could not resist myself I had to root my KFHD. Its good feeling that the community is there to help expand the horizons of the product you paid money for. That's the main reason I did not go for the ipad 3. There just so much you can do with the android platform.  There were a lot of apps missing from the kindle store so I had to root the KFHD.Performance=====================The KFHD is pretty snappy, fast I would say.  Sometimes scrolling through the carousel it stutters.  But for the majority of time it's really good. The silk browser is a total lag fest.  So just installed the dolphin browser and wow now that's fast.  Smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom in.It takes a few seconds for the YouTube app to load completely. Also Google maps takes a few seconds to locate your position. When I mean a few seconds like 10 seconds or less. I am not sure why this is happening.  After loading everything is fine.I put some movies files avi and they played fine. They played really nice with dice player.N64oid works really good on the kindle fire hd.

I was playing dead trigger and I did not see any frame drop and overall enjoyable game. played mass effect infiltrator, asphalt 7 ($.99), shadowgun, and they were running fine. i will try later FPSE see how that goes.Display=======================I like the display colors pop and I like reading a lot on the screen. There is a lot of reflection with sun light so that kind of spoils the fun.  The movies look great on the display no problems here. Also games look really nice on the kindle fire hd. Overall I like the display.Holding volume down + power button at the same time takes a picture of your display.I kind of like the carousel but If could I would want my apps to just show on the main screen like normal android.  I just don't see the point to carousel.  But whatever the case adw launcher ex  is always there.Battery========================The battery last a long time.  I did not mind that they gave us a mini usb cable for the for the kindle fire hd. I used by hd2 charger for the kindle fire it charges fine and fast enough for me.  Why can't customers have the choice to change their own battery? The hp was like this, also the nexus 7.  Why are they copying apple?Sound=================Wow sound is legit on this device. Really loud. Overall really impressed on the sound. Headphone is really good too. Sound is not a problem. 5 stars.  No much to say other than amazon did it right.Camera================Camera is ok , its just whatever.  It nice that it is there. I downloaded from android market camera ics and you can take pictures and videos from the app.  Can control zoom in functions with the apps, also share via Bluetooth, and email via Gmail.Bluetooth================It limited to what it can connect. I could not connected to my ps3 Bluetooth headset.  I could not make it connect to my computer which had a Bluetooth usb. So I guess I ll need to find some devices and meeting the requirements of the KFHD7.Ads==========Ads don't bother me, but I wish they were maybe related to what I liked. But If I feel like they are in my way, since I am already rooted then I remove them manually. Was actually really funny I was showing off my kindle fire hd to someone, and as soon as I turned the kindle there was big titanic advertisement as my lock screen picture, so it was really awkward, I was like uhhhh  yeah I don't like titanic.  Maybe some gamer advertisements would be nice. Xbox 360 or ps3 gaming advertisements.Apps that work after rooting=============================Youtube  v4.1.23Gmail  v4.1.2Google earth 7.0.0.7386Google maps v6.12.0Google talkGroove ip liteCamera icsAutocad ws (looked really good on the kindle fire hd) for any engineers out thereDead trigger ( can play now with ps3 controller)Graph 89 free (like having a ti 89 titanium  but with color )Mass effect infiltratorShadow gun ( can play now with ps3 controller)N64oid (nintendo 64 emulator ( can play now with ps3 controller))Sixaxis controller now I can use my ps3 controller with kindle fire hdDice player to watch avi movies.Adw launcher ex works but if you hit home button it reverts back to the carouselAny app you can think of from the android storeOverall===========All I can say is that I like my kindle fire hd.  I really like that I put some physics books, math books, engineering books, carry them all and read on that nice display. I can then use an app like graph 89 and upload ti 89 titanium operating system on app, it kind of replaces my actual ti 89 titanium. I load some games and so far I like playing games with my ps3 controller. i watched rango, true grid, iron man 2, defiance, mission impossible, and all can say is I like the display and the sound. The performance is great but not perfect. Bluetooth left something to be desired. Rooting the device opens a lot of doors.  I would recommend the device; I would rate it over all 4 stars.  You get a free month of amazon prime.  I think I ll get the amazon prime membership was using my brother one.other notes============as jsh1120 pointed out rooting the device does void your warranty unless you can revert (in some cases you can). please research before doing anything. the youtube tutorial is fairly simple to follow, but if you have never rooted a device before this might be challenging.****Rooting the device will NOT kill your amazon prime instant video streaming capabilities******* amazon prime video streaming is working fine after rooting, i am watching my free movies just fine.update 10/6/2012=================i bought a mini hdmi to hdmi, the kindle fire hd looks really good on the tv, it amazing, i was able to play some n64 games with the ps3 controller in the big tv. brought some nostalgia memories.search youtube \"kindle fire hd Rooted with google apps\" i uploaded this video showing what kindle can do, please note is laggy because i was recording through vnc, and i had no camera."}, {"review_id": "ef1c689f25780354641c150a2bdcd3fe", "review": "I've gotten accustomed to having the web on the go with the free 3G service, however the HD doesn't support it so boo hoo hoo.And how is it possible for me to buy a book yet I cant download a video nor a game because its not offered in my geographic area???!!! !!!WHAT!!!Because Iove to read in bed the back-light feature is awesome.

In short, the TV looked beautiful with a fantastic screen and a great look to it. But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work. It connected to the Internet and acknowledged the connection, but not a single Smart app worked. An hour call into Samsung tech support, who was very accommodating, proved completely fruitless, as they wound up suggesting getting someone out there to service the unit. It was 3 hours after I bought it, so I took it back and bought a different make TV. I could only imagine how complicated the TV would have been for mom had it crashed without me around, and so in the end, it was better for her to have a non-smart TV hooked up to a simple Roku box instead, which is what I did, costing about the same in the end. I will now be very skeptical of Samsung Smart TV features, and would need to see a fully functioning unit in person before ever considering it again.

The 26 was fine but the 32 main board had a blown resistor as well. Samsung will only fix the capacitors and not anything that may happen to the LCD due to cascade failure! Anyhow the price to fix the 32 was close to $300! So for a bit more we bought the 40 with Smart TV.We had tried the better Samsung 40 LED with 3D and faster processor in the past but found the picture with the faster processing to be fake looking and would turn that feature off. The 3D worked but we felt it would be best for a larger TV and will consider it when we replace our Pioneer Elite 60 Plasma. Hopefully not for a long time Just Love that TV and wish Pioneer had stayed in the game.As many reviewers have stated; and it is the case with most slim LEC/LED's with the speakers in the back; the sound can be low at times. We have adjusted the settings for clear voice. It seems that conversation is the first to be effected and the sound can be too low to hear. We always have the remote in the ready to turn the volume up and rewind to hear what we missed. Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking. Our set had a push to the red side and flesh tone was off most of the time. Even now it will shift from time to time. One second the flesh tone will seem fine and the next it looks like everyone has a tan or slight sun burn. Not sure if this is due to the background colors present. Another item is the off screen angle doesn't seem to be as good as the higher level sets. Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright. I prefer the subtle approach and will turn most settings down. If you turn on the Black enhancement features to full you will crush you your shadows and details. I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed. Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p. Don't let the 60Hz scare you or be fooled into needed the 240Hz. The picture is great and as stated before we found the higher speed sets to look fake. Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us. We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless. Having the wireless is a Great feature but a hard connection is always best if you can. The update has added Amazon Prime to the menu which is something we were looking for. We were using our PS3 to connect to Amazon Prime and now only use the Samsung to do so. Amazon Prime has quit a bit of children programing and my son loves Thomas the Train.The remote has all the functions you will need and lights up! It also controls our PS3 if we watch a Blu Ray!The downside. This TV doesn't have a swivel stand! Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set. Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area. This is mainly need for us because we have the TV in the corner. If you had the set straight it would be fine. We bought this TV Swivel at Amazon that works great -B009UDTUNGA minor but weak area is the cable retainer. It does not stick to the stand! The stand has a small area that is not flat to attach the retainer to but the double sided tape to hold the cable retainer to the set keeps falling off. The cable retainer held firmly on one older 26 and 32 Samsungs.For the price it is the perfect set for our living room. We use the Pioneer for our home theater setup.

Much thinner and lighter (12 lbs) than old TV sets, though not as thin as newest sets.  The picture is not as good as plasma in terms of clarity when looking a people's faces, but it is a fine picture.  Using installed apps to access netflix, hulu, etc is terrific.  However,  there  is a discrepancy between what I thought internet access means and what the set actually offers.  If you had planned to catch up on PBS programs or latest missed network TV shows by accessing their sites online or using comcast infinity online, forget it.  During setup you find you cannot update the adobe flash player.  That update is necessary to continue to play those online archives.  Curiously, the content of the network players ran just fine the first time I accessed them until the update notice popped up. After several flash player update failures, the browser refused to run any flash enabled ABC network content except for the introductory ads.  Other folks have had problems accessing any internet content requiring latest flash player.  What is odd is that I had access until I attempted to update.  As mention by others, the web browser is clunky and manipulating a TV remote to access its features is frustrating.  We simply attach an old wireless capable laptop with an HDMI cable to play internet content.  For us, the netflix and other apps offer minimal increase in internet functionality over our old setup with our old TV and a laptop."}, {"review_id": "e821a77f9eae6072816649cf78482270", "review": "The Smart TV is great, and at a very fair price.

It has far exceeded my expectations. Beautiful to look at (I went with the silver) with its retro styling, very comfortable to hold, and and an incredible amount of customization. The IBIS is as good as people say, and the pictures are stunning especially when used with good glass. The kit lenses (14-42, 12-50) are ok, but you won't get the benefit of the great sensor with them. I'm using my OM-D with the Pany 25/1.4, Oly 45/1.8 and Oly 60/2.8 macro and am amazed at my results. And if you are on a budget, definitely take a look at the Sigma 19/2.8 and 30/2.8 being sold together for an unbelievable package price from the famous NY dealers. Both of them have excellent image quality and for 2 bills for the pair of lenses, you can't beat the price for 2 high quality primes. I just ordered the combo package as well though I will likely use the previously mentioned 3 on my OM-D and the 2 Sigmas on my Pen E-PL2 bodies (1 visible and 1 IR).And yes, after getting the OM-D, I realized I didn't want to lug around my heavy arsenal of Nikon bodies (D300, D7000) and lenses any longer. The image quality from the OM-D with the primes listed above far exceeds what I ever got from my Nikon setup so I had no hesitation in selling it all. And with my new setup being so small and light, I find I am much more likely to take it with me. The OM-D and Pany/Oly prime lenses have renewed my interest in photography and I am enjoying every minute.Note: The resolution, noise levels, and dynamic range of the OM-D are very comparable to the newest high end Nikon crop sensor bodies. It still doesn't compare to Nikon Full Frame bodies, obviously the sensor size does limit that, but given the cost of a FF body and FF (FX) lenses, not to mention the weight, I think 90% of photographers would be fine with this set-up.I hope this is helpful."}, {"review_id": "3902d45e63a1dafa4d2c2f3c14ca7cea", "review": "The Olympus OM-D E-M5 (quite a mouthful) costs as much as a mid-level DSLR and after reading glowing reviews from photographers saying they replaced their DSLR for this camera I had unreasonably high expectations. Don't get me wrong, I love this little camera. The AF is insanely fast and accurate and the image quality is great. Here is the list of pros and cons I could come up with.Pros:- Super fast AF. Around the same speed as my Nikon D7000 and probably more accurate. It almost never missed focus.- Lightweight and small. Other have said with the pancake lens it will fit in your pants pocket. They must have really big pockets. There's no way I can fit it with the pancake lens on into a jean pocket. A jacket pocket sure, but not my pants.- Weather sealing!- Touch screen. This is an awesome feature. I can give my wife the camera and tell her to tap the screen on someones face and it takes the picture perfectly in focus.- Lots of lenses to choose from.- Image quality is really good.- Low light noise is pretty amazing for a sensor this small. If you're showing pics on the web, ISO 1600 and 3200 look great and I don't hesitate to use either. ISO 25600 is a marketing trick, it looks like my son drew a water color painting, ISO 12800 isn't great either.- It's built like a tank- The electronic viewfinder is a really nice addition although it's not as nice as an optical viewfinder on any DSLR I've ever used.- Large high quality LCD on the back- Battery life is very good. I took around 300 shots over a three day period and it was still at 3/4 full battery.- The way they positioned the two command dials works perfectly. The thumb and pointer finger rest on both allowing easy access to changing settings.Neutral:- The menu system is neither great nor terrible it just takes some getting used to.- The Buttons are mushy feeling and very small. The camera is small so it's kind of what I expected.Cons:- The included external flash is really weird. It's this tiny little thing you have to carry around in a pouch and it's really awkward to attach it to the camera. They should have just moved the viewfinder over to the side and put a flash in the camera with a hotshoe on top. It's a direct flash and doesn't allow you to pull it back and bounce it. I probably won't use it much if at all.- It's bit hard to firmly hold if you have big hands. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it if I hold it with 1 hand. The grip could be improved.- The metal strap connectors are in a weird place and you have to put them in between your fingers to grip the camera.- The price was a little hard for me to swallow. For what you get it's probably the right price but it's still a lot of money.- This camera does not give DSLR quality images. I can easily spot any pic from my D7000 over a pic from the Olympus. The images are fantastic, don't get my wrong. But the look of the pictures from the camera is a little flatter and less 3 dimensional than a DSLR. It's hard to explain but the bigger sensor in bigger cameras does make a difference in image quality.Final ThoughtsYes the image quality is fantastic but for me this camera does not replace my Nikon D7000. Pictures from my Nikon just look slightly more realistic and have more pop to them. I bought this camera because I hate lugging my DSLR around. It's big and bulky and I never take it hiking or fishing with me. I wanted something that had close to DSLR quality images but in a tiny package I could carry everywhere. I wanted fast and accurate AF and I wanted it to be easy enough for my wife to use. I also wanted interchangeable lenses. With the Olympus I got everything I asked for. No it's not a DSLR replacement like I had hoped it would be. I wouldn't shoot weddings with this camera. Both types of cameras have their place and this little Olympus has found the perfect place into my bag."}, {"review_id": "a39baef0b3362f1d685c80c5450d5a01", "review": "A little bit of history:I started my foray into DSLRs with theOlympus Evolt E510, simply because I used an OM-10 for years before that. Being new to the DSLR game, the \"philosophy\" of 4/3s seemed very sound to me; high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality; of course the added benefit of in-body stabilisation seemed to just make a great sum of parts. I went through a range of 4/3s bodies including theOlympus Evolt E-3and while I was always pleased with the lenses, the image quality always left more to be desired. Also, once I switched to the E-3, the bulk of the system didn't make sense to me as it was pretty similar to full frame and yet lagged in image quality. After 2 years with 4/3s I finally moved on to theNikon D700and have been with it ever since.The caveat of full-frame is obviously the inherent size and weight of the system and I hated being \"the camera guy\" every time I was out with friends or even shooting casually and that's when I started dabbling with micro 4/3s. The initial iterations while exciting, still were slow and not great in terms of IQ, but the E-M5 changed it all. Over the years the system has matured and the E-M5 finally brings a good quality semi-pro body that is small, light, beautiful and most importantly excels in image quality. I use this camera with Panasonic lenses,Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8,Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0&Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica Lensand this entire system fits neatly in a shoulder bag with 3 batteries.I've been shooting with this system for 3 months now and have found the image quality to be very similar to my D700. I still use my D700 for paid work because I'm used to it, but I don't see why the E-M5 wouldn't work for anyone that wants to use it professionally. Of course, the depth of field differences will always exist, but those are inherent characteristics of the systems and it's up to the user to make the best or worst of it.Overall, the E-M5 finally realises what 4/3s was supposed to be and I recommend this camera very highly for anyone that's either looking to enter into a camera system or wants to supplement a full frame system with something smaller and lighter. But of course, there are a few compromises, but none that should be detrimental to use. I also like the new stabilisation system which has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at up to 1s of exposure! Also, the weather sealed body makes a huge difference too.This camera is a definite winner."}], "B00752QXZ2": [{"review_id": "f215fe32a1571970427b511edae7fd8e", "review": "This is sort of like shopping at Costco.

Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc&eacute;e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42\".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55\" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.  Hope this helps!"}, {"review_id": "545e5f7f148b2a6f6cd61678cda94724", "review": ".We purchased this set after returning the disappointing Vizio M3D470KD  3D TV.We love this set. Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, \"soap opera effect.\" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and \"live\" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about."}], "B00752VKFA": [{"review_id": "9f2cbc29e1bfc2324087a38d15d56688", "review": "UPDATE - September 29, 2012So, it's been a few months since I wrote my initial review of the GT50 and I wanted to give another update.Overall, the set is working great. I have not gotten it professionally calibrated, I want to do that next month, but the picture still looks fantastic, both for 2D and 3D content (\"The Avengers\" looks amazing!). Interestingly, I find myself using the THX-Cinema settings just as often, if not more often, than the custom settings I had generated using the various calibration discs. That may be more out of laziness than anything else, to be honest.A few things:1 - If you have a lamp or a window in your room that you think will reflect on the screen, be aware that the anti-glare coating will not cut it during the day. You'll need heavy drapes for the day and use a dimmer or just turn off the lamp at night.  It can be distracting.2 - My biggest frustration is that I am noticing some degree of line bleed, which I guess is a problem with plasmas in general -- I noticed it with my old Samsung but find myself noticing it a lot more with the GT50. I am very frustrated to have to report this to you all and I am going to see what I can do about it, if anything -- again, this is something that happens on all plasmas, apparently, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that I was finding it somewhat distracting.(Line bleeding is when a \"ghost\" version of another element on a screen actually appears on part of the screen where where it shouldn't  -- for example, a character's face might be in front of a window sill -- the \"ghost\" of the sill continues across the character's face.  There is some discussion of line bleed on the GT50 here:[...] )I am not going to change my star rating for my review based on what I am perceiving as a limitation of the technology (as opposed to the set) but it's something to keep in mind. I will be doing some research to see what, if anything, I can do to address the situation and let you know what happens.Finally, I have received a few email inquiring which kind of TV stand I have (in the pictures section). I got the stand in 2007 from IKEA -- sadly, I do not think they make it anymore. It's a pity, it's kind of a perfect TV stand.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter six years, it was time to replace my aging 42\" Samsung plasma (during which a circuit board died, which ended up requiring an all new screen to be installed--thank goodness I had the extended warranty).  At first, I went with the UN55D8000, which was a good looking set, granted, but just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I ended up returning that less than a week after it arrived.  Then I heard about the new Panasonic models coming out, and realized that the GT50 looked like a promising candidate.I have had the TV for less than a week, and there is no way I am returning this incredible plasma television.  I will share some initial thoughts (and have submitted photos as well), and will update my comments later as a kind of progress report.If you care about picture quality and don't feel like waiting for the VT, look no further.  This set has one of the best pictures out of the box I have ever seen, with deep, silky blacks and vibrant (not never overly so) colors. My \"go-to\" test for black levels is the first scene of Episode 9 of the first season of \"Game of Thrones,\" which takes place entirely in the shadows. Quite frankly, I didn't know blu-ray could look so good. The details in the bricks and the clothing, all illuminated by a flickering torch, were astounding. There was a real sense of depth and clarity, even with this very dark scene--incredible.  I dialed in my own settings using the Spears and Munsil disc, but the settings included in the THX- Cinema mode worked really well and are a great starting point.The color controls for this TV are very extensive, and I think a professional calibrator could really make this set sing. I will get a real calibration done in a month and let you know how it goes. Suffice to say, once I dialed in the proper brightness and contrast and turned pretty much everything else off (and making sure to turn the \"panel brightness\" to low)--the set was great.I watched \"Tron\" in 3D using the Oppo BDP-93, and was very impressed with the 3D and the clarity of the picture. I don't have a lot of 3D content, so I will make sure to add more comments once I see more films. The glasses, which are not cheap, are light and quite comfortable, though it's annoying you are supposed to charge them via the TV--when the TV is on.  It would be nice if they came with little carrying cases or bags, but no such luck.I have DirecTV and the 1080i picture looks fantastic, as does the AppleTV's 1080p. It is with Blu-ray, however, that this set really feels most at home. I cannot overstate how rich the contrast is; my wife continues to comment on how much she notices the better picture, which is a great sign!I have this plugged into my sound system, so I haven't even heard the speakers, really, so I can't comment on the sound quality.As I illustrate in the pictures, the HDMI ports are very close to the side of the cabinet, so if you have thicker HDMI cables, you really need to coax them, gently, down the side so they don't poke out behind the set. I have a set of Bluejeans cables, which work just fine, but my Better Cables HDMI is definitely very close to the edge.  Speaking of cables, while the set does come with a cable stay, there is only 1 (though there are four places to put it)--Panasonic really needs to included another.The bezel is very thin and the set is not that much thicker than the Samsung LCD I had just a few weeks ago. I really like how it looks in the room.  The screen swivels about 10 either direction, which is nice. It's also much lighter than I thought it would be; I was able to put the stand on and lift it into place by myself (though, clearly, you should have someone help you--I was just excited).This is a really great set. I haven't seen the ST50, but I can't help but feel that the extra 24,000 shades of grey really push this TV to a higher level of picture quality. I am extremely, extremely pleased so far, and I am looking forward to putting it through its paces--and will let you know how it goes!Update (4/11/12):I started playing with the Internet Apps last night and wanted to add a few notes:1 - Every time I press \"Viera Tools\" or \"Internet\" I am kind of shocked how fast the interface comes up. This is, by far, the fastest interface I have ever used, thanks to the dual processor.  It's so fast that you start to get the feeling that you might actually USE the Internet on this thing!2 - Panasonic does have a web browser (App Store:LifeStyle) but it's a pain to download (you have to enter in your credit card information even though the application is free); I just wish it was included. I am going to fill out my credentials on the vieracast website because it's kind of annoying to enter in the data using the remote.3 - The YouTube interface is actually pretty nice. The text is displayed larger than on the AppleTV  and you can sort by HD Content only, which the AppleTV does NOT let you do--so that's very cool.4 - I still need to check out Netflix, Hulu +, Vudu and other applications. The GT50 offers a very comprehensive assortment of online services and, like I said, it's very easy and intuitive to get to.Other things:1 - Clicking on Viera Tools brings up a toolbar on the lower part of the screen from which you can access various items:- 3D options- THX options - basically, switch from THX Cinema to THX Bright Room and one other THX mode. Pretty good for testing out your custom settings with the THX ones.- Viera Connect - pretty much the same as pressing the \"Internet\" button on the remote- Media Player- DLNA - wasn't applicable to my system- Viera Link - not really sure what the difference is between Viera Connect and Viera Link; I will check it out and update this post- Eco - adjusts the auto-brightness features- eHelp - access to the 208 page manual via a specialized interface2 - There IS an iOS app (and I would assume an Android App) that can take the place of the supplied remote control. Useful, I guess, for Harmony users who may need specialized controls from time to time.  This seemed to work well for the most part but I have some thoughts:- The app makes ridiculous sounds when using the remote. You can turn the sounds off.  Really silly.- The trackpad controls are the default screen, but you cannot control the TV with them. You need to swipe to another pane to get to the arrow keys to navigate the menus. This was confusing at first and then just kind of irritating, because you have to go to one page to call up \"Options\" then swipe to another page to interact with the options.- The reason why I gave up entering my credentials to get the web browser was because the keyboard on the iOS app was NOT sending text to the TV. This is clearly a bug, but once it is fixed, this will work like the AppleTV, where you can use your iOS device to type into the TV, which is obviously much better than using the remote. Lame it's not working for me, though.- There is an iPad specific app which I have looked at but I haven't used with the TV (I don't know if it consolidate the various panes, will update).So, I dunno how important these services and Internet features are to you. I really like my AppleTV, so I already have most of them, but am curious to see Vudu's video quality and check out how Dolby Digital Plus sounds--I hope it works the Toslink output.  I personally will be using my iPad or Phone to deal with Facebook, twitter, etc -- even though image retention and burn-in are much less likely to be a problem on modern plasmas, I don't really feel like tempting fate with having a static web browser interface on the screen while I am surfing the web.hope this update helps!4/15/23 Quick updateTried the 3D. Here's what I got:1 - 2D-3D conversion was nothing to write home about. I didn't know if it was working half the time. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just gave me a headache.2 - Straight up 3D is awesome. Watched beginning of Hugo and found it hard to press \"Stop\". If you are into the 3D, you MAY want to get the 55\" for a more immersive experience, but the 50\" was fantastic, regardless. I still think the glasses make your eyes get tired, but still--the depth is really great, and the sense of immersion with \"floaty-bits\" was really top notch, at least in \"Hugo\".  Look, 3D might look brighter on the LED/LCD set I had before, but there was a sense of depth here that I felt lacking in the Samsung I tried out.3 - I have a few \"THX\" Blu-rays. I watched them in \"THX Cinema\" mode and they looked awesome. Maybe THX is not necessarily just hype?4 - Demo'ed the streaming services. Vudu's HDX format is no joke--it looks incredible, close (from my viewing distance) to Blu-ray, totally. HOWEVER, I could not get Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 (which is supposed to sound GREAT) output from the Toslink output on the TV. I am pretty sure DD+ requires HDMI, so that explains it. Still, DD+ includes the DD 5.1 mix and that sounded great. I was really impressed with the Vudo service and I think I will use it. Amazon and Netflix both looked great as well.  I still like the AppleTV UI, but this ain't half bad.Note: I talked to someone on the Panasonic \"Raise the Bar\" tour and she acknowledged that the iOS remote control app had some issues (the Android one is supposed to work fine) and that my problem (the keyboard not working) was going to be fixed soon. It was kind of cool that she knew about that.Finally, I put up some new photos showing a few off-axis viewing examples, a bird's eye view of the swivel angle, and some shots showing Vudu and Amazon content.thanks-m"}], "B0075SUK14": [{"review_id": "e714703292b1beaece7ee9d52a40012b", "review": "We just returned from a trip overseas and brought both the S95 and the SX260. We have owned the S95 for the past 2 years and really liked the camera but we wanted to get another camera as a backup and also to get one with a higher optical zoom. We tested both cameras in multiple situations on the trip and came to the conclusion that the S95 takes better night shots but the SX260 takes better shots in the day and the 20X optical zoom is extremely useful. The S95 allows you to go full manual but the SX260 gives you many options to play with your photo taking. Overall, if I could only take one camera I would take the SX260 because the optical zoom and picture quality is great. The night photos were pretty good too but not as good as the S95 (obviously if you are planning on taking more night shots, then the S95/100 would probably be better for you). On a side note, the GPS on the SX260 sucks battery life very quickly and the camera has a difficult time finding the GPS signal (we left it off for most of the trip)"}, {"review_id": "ae7da972339eff5880a9302232933235", "review": "I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick ...UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there. You look at what you plan to take, compare it to the SX260 LCD screen and press the shutter button."}, {"review_id": "36ea0af5b5ae70c6bc70317b2bbf9295", "review": "This camera had a great price for what you need in picture taking ..

The GPS is a gimmick, but it does work well in placing your photos if you want to display them on GOOGLE Earth. However, the housing restricts that feature. The 12.1 megapixels are great for even posters or flat screen televisions (I use mine through my Blu-ray disc player for YOUTUBE). The function set, display, menu and the dial are all easy and intuitive. The zoom is remarkably steady (I recommend a small tripod). I've never cared for Optical Zoom, but the 20X works as well as any.This is really a remarkable camera for the price. I have yet to test the stereo microphones, but I can imagine that for the family filmmaker, this might be fun to watch and listen to on a television with stereo speakers.

I was seriously considering the Panasonic VIERA TC-L32X5, but I had hope in the same quality of picture with the Samsung. The picture on this 32-inch TV is great, and I have enjoyed watching things even more than the old Sony 27-inch tube TV we had.The sound is acceptable for now, BUT I expect that when summer comes, and we are running fans and window air conditioners, it might not be loud enough (from personal experience with the smaller TV I have upstairs). This TV DOES NOT have any audio outputs, so I am disappointed with that, and removed 1 star (I would have gone 4.5 stars).

I'm not sure how much protection it would provide if the device was dropped but it offers a better grip than the slick iPad and so makes it less likely that it will be dropped.

On those, I use a Belkin Snap Shield in conjunction with an Apple Smart Cover to provide protection and allow me to type or watch video using the Smart Cover stand features. I was disappointed to find that Belkin (or DeviceWear) hasn't got a Snap Shield type back for the Mini. However, in looking for those products, this case kept coming up as a decent, well reviewed case that seemed to offer what I was looking for.The case itself is cheaply made, but is light and fits the iPad Mini well. I actually really like the back portion - the cutouts are well placed and that part is good looking.As for the cover: The on/off feature works and even though the cover is stiff and not as nice as a real Smart Cover, I could have lived with that. The cover doesn't lie perfectly flat, but I could live with that. What I can't live with is that this case will not function as a stand. You can fold the cover into a triangle, but there are no magnets to keep the triangle together. Without those, the iPad might remain upright for a 4 or 5 seconds before it collapses. I can't believe that didn't put anything in there to support the triangular cover. In fact, if they would have included another magnet in the back of the case, they could have made a very sturdy and reliable stand that would have made this a great value.Today, I returned this case and  got a \"real\" iPad Mini Smart Cover from Apple and even though it is overpriced, the stand functionality is solid. I feel confident when I roll up the cover to make the triangle, it's not going anywhere. Additionally, the quality of the cover is much nicer and feels much more comfortable folded back behind the iPad. I appreciate these things, but would have been happy with the Poetic case, if they would have only added something to make the stand work. Now, I'm waiting on delivery of a thin TPU case that will hopefully take the place of the SnapShield."}, {"review_id": "15ecd88decbb7ee976f9aed15a430b74", "review": "The case was very thin and light. The cover art was very nicely done. The sleep feature worked well. Folding the cover back to rest the mini, however wasn't what I expected. Sometimes it would unfold and felt unstable. Though I loved how light and thin it was, the cover offered little protection to the mini. I was constantly worried about dropping it or breaking the mini. That's just a personal thing, I'm sure, if you have no qualms then there is no problem. I didn't purchase the case as much for protection but when I realized how thin the mini is, I felt I needed something more sturdy. I bought an otter box which I normally hate and use it instead. I feel that it is much more protected and the otter box didn't weigh it down as badly or make it much thicker as I thought it would.

I can say if you don't really need 1080p then there's really no need to get the newer version. Only a few sources at this point are 1080p. The iTunes store is the main source where you will greatly benefit from the 1080p. There are quite a few tv shows and movies in 1080p in the iTunes store to rent or buy. If your buying this device for 1080p on Netflix then there still aren't that many movies or tv shows. Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version. The only way to get apps and more streaming services on your apple tv 3 is to use air play with either an iPad , iPhone or iPod touch. At this point there is no jailbreak available on the apple tv 3. I didn't notice a difference in performance on the newer apple tv 3. Also I personally didn't notice a difference in picture quality between my apple tv 2 and 3. If you already have an apple tv 2 then I don't think you need to upgrade to the newer one. Also if you are considering an apple tv at this time and don't have tv that is 46 inches or larger I would strongly recommend looking at getting a refurbished apple tv 2 for $69 directly from appple. I decided the return my apple tv 3 and just get the refurbished older model. It's cheaper, easier to jailbreak and still has the great features and interface.I still find the aplle tv 3 overpriced when compared to other streaming devices that it competes with. But for the air play functionality alone it makes a great accessory for the iPad , iPhone and iPod touch.

The only thing I find remotely useful is having an iPad or iPhone and watch youtube or amazon instant from it. All you need is to spend another $300 - $400 more to get this functionality. I am very disappointed with this for that reason. The apps/channels are limited. It seems to be yet another $100 accessory to an iPad/iPhone. On its own, I think the market has better products that offer more, like Roku and Chromecast, either better price or more features.I was looking forward to mirroring functionality of this as well, but again I was disappointed, the video pauses and then tries to catchup and the audio keeps cutting in and out. This happened with simple things like trying to play a slideshow from iPhoto. Watching videos or mirroring a game is out of the question. I am not really sure what use it is. Maybe PowerPoint without transitions or displaying something static.If you are an Apple-only fan and have the full apple suite, this product my be for you because I'm sure you can overlook all of these issues that I have had.I would suggest looking into Roku or Chromecast, or if you have PS3/4, Xbox360/One, or a Smart TV, you probably have the majority of what this offers."}], "B007JF85WE": [{"review_id": "bb9d79ccc3407bbd812941d4e718d6b3", "review": "This is a fine set of receiver, but I have my own issues with it.

I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great.  I received it about three days ago and I really like it.  I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big.  I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3\" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7\" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7\".  You can wait until July when supposedly a 7\" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200.  It is supposed to have better specs.

They had a bundle package with the tablet sleeve included for $239 (few bucks more than Amazon price after tax but you do get a 90 day exchange).I have to say so far I am very impressed with this samsung tablet.  Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great.  I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few \"lit\" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.I think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one.  I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point.  So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down.  I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet.  I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire.  I think this may be the tablet that wins out for travel and just couch browsing.

Blurex leather slim folio case is ok, but I did not like how the case is when in the open position, doesnt lay flat.  The other one I tried is the MoKo 360 degree rotating case, which the concept is great, but the back of it seems rather large since it has the swivel functionality.  Probably going to send all of these back.  Just for fun I snapped in the galaxy tab 2 inside my old Kindle Fire case the (Ace Flip Case by Casecrown) and it fits perfect.

Now of course there is no camera hole in the back but all the other ports are fully accessible and this cases still allows you to pop out the corner to position the galaxy tab in landscape mode for reading.  They also lay very flat when open which is nice when reading, etc.  Just a thought if someone is looking for a cheaper case (no rear camera hole)."}, {"review_id": "676f1f1d29e78c88a95e73d905a7ab73", "review": "I purchased the Tab 2 for my fianc&eacute; and she absolutely loves it!

All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches. The iPad is a solid performer in the hardware and software aspect but is made for people that like to be told what to do and not do with their devices... Apple has a sick way of doing that and they always leave you wanting more when you know they could have provided all those things they intentionally left out so next year they can introduce it in their new iPad and have you go crazy for the new little feature that your old iPad should have included for the premium you paid.Then comes a solid company like Asus and comes up with a brilliant idea of making \"Transformer\" tablets, no tablet is perfect and Asus is no exception but the TF300 is everything I want a tablet to be with some room for improvement but not so much you'll cry about it because other have it and you dont. ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer. The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is \"optional\" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10\" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life.

I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time.

MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed \"read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.\"  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32."}, {"review_id": "5551da9237b95be61a0fb68e7f213f7f", "review": "This product is perfect for what I needed it for.

Only two firmware updates since the release and main issues are not addressed. I've upgraded to R7000 which has a lot more support.UPDATE 12/26/2013Recently purchased a few latest AC routers specifically Asus RT-AC68U, Linksys EA6900, Dlink DIR-868L, Netgear R7000 and ended up going back to R6300V2. None offered more range or performance of R6300V2 despite having external antennas. While most of these new high end routers had some additional features, some of them had really unstable firmware, especially RT-AC68U & EA6900.  Netgear R7000 is probably the best of the bunch and I would've kept it if I didn't have R6300V2 already. It doesn't really bring more range or performance either and it barely has any new features especially for average user, but at least Netgear has more interest in keeping it up to date with frequent firmware updates.UPDATE 7/30/2013Bought R6300v2 to see if there is any difference. V2 now comes with dual core processor 800Mhz, 256MB of RAM and USB 3.0, it is also twice as small and comes with smaller power supply. All nice upgrades, but did it translate into better performance? In short, yes. For regular users, they may not notice the difference, but if you have gazillion of gadgets that use WiFi especially HD streaming you will be pleased that it offers better performance. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up, but overall this upgrade is totally worth it for my busy wifi network.UPDATE 6/27/2013My R6300 is now over a year old and it actually performs better then it did when it was initially released thanks to several firmware updates. I've tried latest AC offerings from Dlink & Asus and they just didn't offer as good range and reliability as R6300. Netgear might release a replacement soon, but for now this is still the best overall AC router despite what reviews say on smallnetbuilder website.UPDATE 1/9/2013I've been using this router for over half a year now and it hasn't skipped the beat. Performance has been top notch and it can handle 15 wireless clients with a few HD IP Cameras. It's been running uninterrupted for the past 3 month. Sure there are other new AC routers that came out since then, which I haven't tested, but this has been a wonderful router so far and I am not looking for another replacement at the moment. Not surprising that the price is exactly what I paid 6 month ago, which means the router is actually holds its value for being one of the best out there.INTROMy past 3 year history of routers include Netgear WDR3700, Cisco E4200 and most recently two Asus RT-N56u using wireless bridge, but I was never impressed with the speed of wireless and 5Ghz band coverage. This was about time for my next upgrade, so I bought 3 routers RT-N66U, Amped Wireless R20000G & Netgear R6300 and I kept the latter and here is why:THE GOOD:- Range/Speed/Performance in 5 Ghz band: Excellent! While not a huge leap forward it does perform much better than any of the previous and competing routers I've tried using this band. This was a major selling point for me. It is actually able to provide excellent download speeds in the opposite corner of the 1500 sq/feet townhome that none of the other routers could handle. Also with Mac Mini 2010 Broadcom wifi, I was able to achieve up to 22 MB/sec download speed from NAS at about 15 feet with latest firmware. Previously with RT-N56 it topped at 10 MB/sec at the same location. That's double the speed! I can't wait to try this out with AC clients!- Range/Speed/Performance in 2.4 Ghz band: The range is excellent. It covers my entire home, but so did my previous router, so it's difficult to judge the improvement here.  However, there is noticeable performance boost. Among several wireless devices using this band I have 4 HD (1080p - 720p) IP cameras and previous Asus router had trouble with handling all of them with good frame rate where with R6300 I am finally able to stream all of them at once. Also, your performance will depend on the client. Previously I was using 2010 HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 which was showing download speed at 4-6 MB/sec, 2012 HP Envy 17 w/ Intel 6300 showing much better results at 6-8 MB/Sec at the same location. While Mac Mini 2010 w/ Broadcom WiFi shows speeds less then 1MB sec. Basically, older clients may have some performance issues.- Setup:  It wasn't complicated all and looks fairly straight forward for non-technical people as well.- Plenty of features for basic and advanced users: Guest network, Wireless bridge etc... all thereI CAN DEAL WITH IT:- Size: This router is about twice the size of any of the previous routers I've owned- Guest Network: Yes, it's available, but it's very basic. I've seen Asus RT-N66U guest network control which lets you specify the time limit or expiration.- Administration panel locks after about a minute of inactivity and you are prompted to enter your username & password again (very annoying when you trying to troubleshoot things!)- Parental features. I don't like the fact that you need to install tool on your pc, there is no web administration on management in the web ui.OTHER THINGS:- First router that I see without WEP setting.- Some of the older clients (specifically HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 card) had connection issues with sleep/restart. I've upgraded my laptop since then and have not had this issue anymore- Mine appears to be defective where the activity lights at the bottom are not lighting up, except Netgear logo. (UPDATE 7/10 I've gotten a new one without this issue)PREVIOUS UPDATES:UPDATE 10/13: This is probably going to be my last update since I really don't have anything else to add other then this has been a wonderful router ever since I upgraded to 1.0.2.36_1.0.28 version. I've been running without reboots for a month now and no problems with performance whatsoever.UPDATE 9/6: 3 month later and still loving this router. If you live in a large home and have wireless coverage issues with 5 Ghz band you should definitely give this one a try. Overall it's been rock stable for me with only one nagging issue related to 5Ghz band (see my previous update). Netgear support got a hold of me and I've been helping them to troubleshoot the issue by sending router logs. They provided a beta update for me that fixed the issue which they will be releasing in September.UPDATE 7/10: Month later the router still performs very well. I am hoping for new firmware soon to improves performance and compatibility with older devices. Still have issues with Envy 14, Mac Mini 2010 and also HTC Sensation phone. They all exhibit different issues. First one takes a long time to connect, second one has very low speed on 2 Ghz band and last one occasionally unable to connect. There was also one hiccup. I was running uninterrupted for 2 weeks straight using latest firmware and 5Gh signal degraded from Excellent to Poor and 4 to 2 bars at the same location. I've rebooted the router and everything went back to normal.UPDATE 6/13: 2 weeks now with the router. Sold my two Asus N56U that I used as a wireless bridge and that were once highly rated at SNB. I honestly do not know why SNB posted terrible results with R6300, they must have defective unit but that's still not the case for me. I am perfectly satisfied with R6300 and it delivers excellent performance/range throughout the house without the need of any bridges or extenders which I once had to use. I do have defective unit where I don't get any activity lights, so I might exchange it at some point. Did I mention, this is an awesome router?UPDATE 6/7: Netgear released new firmware which enables Guest network that caused so much noise and negative reviews in the initial release, the were no other fixes listed, but upon my own checking I noticed they added \"Performance boost\" option in the Advanced > Wireless settings. I performed my usual download test which showed a slight increase in download speed on 5Ghz band, but it's hard to say if it was related to the firmware or not.UPDATE 6/4: SmallNetBuilder released preliminary test results that compare performance R6300 with a few other N routers that show that it doesn't perform as good as expected in some cases. Also mentioned my results in the process when compared to N56U. I only had R6300 for a few days now, but my experience for the most part has been positive even with a rough firmware. Also, I usually base my router purchases by SNB reviews, but in this case I am having different results, so I'll stick with R6300 for now."}], "B00829THK0": [{"review_id": "c6fead79830aefd7b4ffdcbd36d372d9", "review": "I've had one of these Seagate backup drives before so I was confident that what I was getting was a great product.

The info is included in the quick-start guide. I found the driver with a minimum of hassle, it downloaded OK, and after a quick reboot, the drive was visible in the Windows explorer.* File transfer seems reasonably fast- I copied 1.4GB in about 1:40, for an average speed of about 14MB/S.* The drive is a nice form factor. It will just about fit in a shirt pocket-if you have oversized shirt pockets. It weigns about the same as my iPhone, so not real heavy or too hard to carry.===The Not-So-Good Stuff===*The drive only has a USB3.0 port, so you need a 2.0/3.0 cable. One is included, but a USB 2.0 port would have been nice in case you forget the cable.* The Seagate Dashboard software did not inspire confidence. The copy on the drive was corrupted, so I downloaded a fresh copy from the Seagate website. That worked OK, but I could never get the automated backup to work. According to the included manual, on the Home page of Seagate dashboard there is a \"protect\" button to start the backup process. I never got this button to show itself.* The other major selling point of the Dashboard is the ability to backup data/images from Facebook, Flicker and YouTube. I am not quite sure why I would want to do this, and my natural paranoia keeps me from giving Facebook any sort of access to anything having to do with my local drive. To its credit, the Dashboard software seems to allow disabling of this access. Still-just makes me nervous-I don't trust Facebook to be anywhere near my personal drive.* Installing the Dashboard software seemed to load a LOT of software-look like a whole Microsoft C++ distribution kit.  The uninstall seems to mostly work (it did throw an error for a file not found. Unfortunately it didn't seem to offer the option to uninstall all the Microsoft stuff in downloaded, and I am not sure where exactly it put it. Oh well, disk space is cheap enough.===Summary===The drive works great for PC bulk storage. It has a nice form factor, and the HFS driver seems well behaved.

The USB 3.0 cable is included and that's a nice plus these days.My primary concern is with the Seagate registration software - it pulls your email address right off your computer with no 'by your leave' or anything. Makes me wonder if I am installing adware by using the software....Seagate claims that you receive a year of cloud storage with the drive. The email received from Seagate states to click on the 'cloud storage icon' to access this feature. The problem is there is no 'cloud storage icon' in the Seagate Dashboard software. I discovered on the support site that the cloud service is NOT compatible with MAC - lovely. They do not tell you that in the product documentation = FAIL.The Seagate Dashboard software is fairly simple and does not take a great deal of space on the HD. Basic information, drive management and testing are available from the dashboard/backup plus panel. Then we came to let me backup on the drive - NOPE - would not allow any of that. The dashboard software had no protect icon as depicted in the online manual = FAILSo, what's the end result? You get an external drive - it's 'special' options DO NOT WORK with Mac - even though they claim to. I was unable to review the rest of those functions for that very reason. Greatly disappointed in Seagate for submitting an inferior software product claiming to do things that it is not capable of doing.The only PRO of this review is that it is a nice, 500GB external HD with a decent form factor and connection.

I have many many external hard drives from a gambit of manufacturers, and here's how this one holds up:PROS:- Fairly Fast: though by no means the fastest on the market, it is by no means the slowest. I'm copying 40gb of video on there right now and it says the estimated wait time is 30 minutes. Not too bad. And in actuality it will probably be closer to 20 minutes.- Sleek design: though external hard drive owners are probably more concerned with keeping their files safe, the design here will hopefully also appeal to the trendy-seekers too. I like the silver stripe and the overall look and feel. Definitely more attractive than my others.- Runs quiet/cool: doesn't make any hideous chugging sounds and doesn't get extremely hot. This is good news.- Good price. 3 TB isn't anything to laugh at, so I think this device is quite affordable given the amount of data it can holdCONS:- For Windows users, you will have to download software from their website for the computer to recognize the external hard drive. Honestly, I would rather have something without any software at all. I just want my files on there like a mega USB drive. But whatever, it isn't that big of a deal. For Mac users, you will be able to install the software directly after connecting it to your computer.OVERALL: As long as the drive doesn't crash on me, I can't really complain about it. Good amount of memory, good speed, quiet/cool, nice design. I have a few other Seagates and they seem to be a good brand. No issues. I'd recommend this one as well.

If you find a make/model that runs reliably, you love that make/model.  If you have a bad experience (or two, or three) with a make/model, you hate that make/model.  That said, Seagate hasn't failed me over the years.  So I love this hard drive.Background:  We're moving into a blended, Apple-Microsoft home, as are many other families these days.  It starts maybe with an Apple iPod, then iPod Touch, then an iPhone, then you start eyeing those sleek Macs at the Apple store, and then....  But we're not ready to move to an all-Apple home anytime soon.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to move data back-and-forth between those two environments when you're dealing with lots of files?What I appreciate about this Seagate is the Windows driver that Seagate provides on their website to allow you to connect this ready-for-Mac hard drive to any Windows computer.  Google \"Seagate crossplatform\" to find the Windows driver to use this Seagate on a Windows machine.  Note, though, that whenever I connect this drive to Windows, it throws the warning, \"Do you want to scan and fix Seagate Backup Plus Drive?\"  If you click Yes, nothing happens -- no apparent way to get rid of this message.  That doesn't appear to affect the ability to read/write to the drive using Windows, though.Speed and performance seemed good.  Using a 1.7GB test directory, I got 24MB/sec write, and 38MB/sec read using USB 2.0.CONCLUSION:  I love Seagate...until this or another Seagate drive fails me."}, {"review_id": "37f6eebf2dde5a2ccc806f0114ba1f10", "review": "The instructions that came with this drive say to go to this site:support.seagate.com/crossplatformto get the driver for Windows; I'm using Windows 7. That is not a valid site however. I had to search for the necessary software and found it here:[...]Once you get the Windows driver installed and are able to see the drive in Windows Explorer you will find that you have 2.72 TB that is actually usable on a 3TB drive. You will find video tutorials that show how to protect your files and how to use to drive when working with social media (like Facebook). I found the videos to be of very low quality. I could barely see what it was trying to demonstrate but they were somewhat useful if you choose to use their software.You will also get a free 1 year subscription to store you data on a cloud drive. I'd rather not keep my personal files on a cloud drive since I don't want my personal information stored on a server somewhere that could be accessed by others.Using their dashboard software it will automatically copy every non-system file (theoretically this will be your videos, music, and other files that you don't want to lose). I tried out their software and found that it works pretty well. It was easy to learn and use and this method of maintaining your data will appeal to a lot of people. Personally, I prefer not to use the software that came with this drive and have no desire to use it with social media. For that reason, I chose to simply format the drive after experimenting a bit with their software and now have a completely empty drive. It still says there is 2.72 TB available after formatting.According to the literature regarding USB3 is capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 5GB/second. However, when transferring appx. 500MB from the hard drive on my computer to this drive, I found that I had a transfer rate that varied between 30MB and 40MB/second. So, theoretically, transferring 500MB of data should take less than a second but it took about 10 minutes! I wonder if I'm missing something... My computer does have a USB3 port and I am using the USB3 cable that came with this drive. I don't think the slow speed is because of the main drive that is on my PC. Does anyone have an idea why this transfer speed is so slow; relatively speaking?That said, this drive seems to be reliable (after a weeks usage) and it is very quiet.

In order to use with Windows, you do in fact have to download the HFS+ driver from the Seagate website and reformat the drive (at least, this drive wasn't recognized by my PC running Windows 7). Of course if you are a Windows-only user, you probably would not even consider this product because of the name \"Backup Plus for Mac\". (You'd probably get the sister productSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101), which also costs less.) Also, I'm not sure if this Backup Plus for Mac can go back to Mac once it is reformatted for Windows. I got it for my Mac and was afraid to try it.For this Seagate drive, which is an upgrade from theSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STAC3000102, it has a much slicker look and a unique adapter compatible with USB, Firewire and Thuderbolt. It also comes with convenient software called \"Dashboard\" which lets you upload and download pictures and videos to and from social media, a feature a lot of casual users will appreciate. If you frequently upload media from different devices such as a smart phone, tablet, digital camera, and desktop computer to Facebook, Flickr, or wherever, and want them backed up, this software really makes your job easier. What is more, it organizes photos by creating folders of each photo album, timeline, cover and profile.On my Mac, I have three other external drives attached in addition to this one, so I decided to do a quick benchmark test. I timed the speed to copy 2.6GB photos from my Mac to each drive. I used the same USB cable and the same USB port for all four tests.

Not only is it super affordable, but it's very functional. I like the 3 deep grooves for the iPad to rest on (its super secure, it won't collapse or anything). At first I was worried that the case when placed in the groove would stick out too much (and my son would spill food on the inside of the case this way), but it doesn't jut out as bad as I thought it would. They provide an elastic to hold the cover together when you flip it all the way back so it doesn't flop around. The only downside is that elastic covers a sliver of the iPad's right side of the screen.The hand grip is super useful and very stretchy. I have small hands and it accommodates it nicely. This case is made for right handed people though. The hand holder goes on your left hand and you use your right hand to tap the screen. I'm not sure if lefties can use it, since there's only one way you can orient your iPad (because of the cut-out for the camera on the case).The auto-wake and close works great! The magnetic snap is rounded to fit the curve of the side of the iPad so you have to actually exert slight pressure to snap it shut as well as push it slightly to open it.

Read the original review, it is still true.I bought this particular product because I need high capacity \"live\" and fast storage while I consolidate and re-organize the video materials that underlie the almost 900 YouTube videos I have created.I bought a USB 3 adapter (Winstars WS-UH302P USB 3.0 PCI-Express Card, 2 external port) from a local computer vendor: the data transfer rate difference between USB3 and USB2 is well worth the cost of the adapter ... and the price on this HDD device is excellent!

They store our files, they help us to communicate, we use them in our work, and much more.  Our computers have become an essential part of our lives, as necessary as a car or a microwave.  In some cases, a computer may be more important than some of the things we previously considered key devices in our life.As our expectations of our computers has grown, so too have our expectations regarding memory.  Just a short time ago, we thought 100's of megabytes (or even megabytes) was a lot of memory, only to find that even a terabyte could be filled with memories and entertainments.  Expansion drives provide a relatively cost effective way of adding storage to a computer, particularly if the computer is doing everything you need it to do with respect to processing power.This particular expansion drive seems to be a cost-effective way to add a lot of memory to a computer.  This drive is compatible with USB 3.0 and includes a USB 3.0 cable.  The transfer speed of USB 3.0 is about ten times faster than the previous, widespread standard, USB 2.0.  The faster speed means that, if you have a USB 3.0 interface on your computer, this expansion drive will appear to operate nearly as fast as your internal drive with respect to transferring files, except for very large files.  As one example, we loaded a movie (not high resolution) onto this drive and played the movie flawlessly from the drive.  The only flaw with the transfer speed is that it says nothing about the speed of the hard drive itself, which I was unable to figure out.  For the kinds of files I typically save, it was sufficiently fast.This drive is plug and play.  Connect the drive to your computer, and seconds later, it shows up as a drive on your directory.  The drive operates just like any other folder on your drive.  You may readily move files into and out from the drive, or launch files directly from the drive.  You should eject or shut down the drive before disconnecting it from your computer.While this drive seems to have a lot going for it, there are a couple of potential issues or annoyances, and one possible concern.This drive lays flat.  I have one other Seagate 2 TB external drive that stands up vertically.  I prefer the vertical arrangement because it takes up less space on the desk where I typically use the hard drive.  I have accidentally pulled the vertical hard drive over because I forgot to disconnect the cable, which is clearly not an issue with this hard drive, though that particular issue has not happened to me recently with my vertical external drive.Another possible problem is that this drive gets warm if it is used for very long.  One reason this could be an issue is the location where the drive is used.  Many people are heading to the desert in support of various U.S. initiatives and taking an expansion drive with them.  Since air conditioning is not ubiquitous in many of these locations, overheating is a potentially significant concern.Yet another incipient issue is decreased life.  I have seen some concerns regarding this particular drive and a shortened life, but the reports seem to be preliminary and may be isolated failures.  I think there is insufficient data at this point to be a cause for alarm, but neither am I sufficiently comfortable with the reliability of this drive to recommend it without a least a bit of reservation.  I suggest monitoring reviews on Amazon or doing some additional research to see whether these drives suffer from a shortened life.One thing I find troubling is the location of vent holes in the case.  I am a big fan of venting for electronics that have the potential to get warm.  This drive has vent holes on the bottom and on the back, but that does not necessarily optimize flow of air through the drive.  While the position of these holes prevents spilled fluids from readily entering the drive, the position of the holes is less than optimum from an airflow perspective, which may be part of the reason this drive seems to get warm.I now have several external drives.  I think the primary reason is my paranoia that highly valuable files will be lost because of some unforeseen and catastrophic circumstance.  I can replace my computer reasonably quickly, but I cannot replace the files on the computer.  Thus, I have an external hard drive set up for automatic backup, another hard drive available for transporting files, and a hard drive backup to the primary backup.  Yes, I have many duplicate files, but at least I minimize the risk that the files will be lost permanently.  The particular hard drive appears to be cost-effective and small.  I am a little concerned about the life of the drive, but it will take me time to learn whether that is an issue.  Until then, this drive is now an important part of my life.Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "9f83e3c6b7330cd9c180d0eaf2a593eb", "review": "THE QUICK TAKE:  The Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBV2000100 is a good option as a backup drive, or as an expansion drive that isn't used intensively.  It may also serve well as a working drive that's used more intensively but for temporary or replaceable files - such as a scratch drive or a media server.This drive is large enough and priced low enough that you can backup multiple computers for not a lot of money.However, if you're looking for an expansion drive - a second drive to augment a laptop or desktop - that you will use intensively, consider options with cooling and perhaps backup, especially if you will use the drive for your only copy of files.A DESKTOP DRIVE:  This is a desktop drive, not a truly portable drive.  You could use it to backup multiple computers around a home or office, but you're not going to enjoy carrying the drive and the power supply.A FAST CONNECTION:  USB 3.0 really is fun to use, if you have the right port on your computer to use it.  No more sitting around watching file transfers - the speeds are similar to those of a built in drive.KEEP A BACKUP: One of the keys to happiness in modern life is to keep at least two copies of every computer file you need.  If you have anything you would rather not have vanish tomorrow, get a hard drive - any hard drive - and make a copy. Right now.  Err on the side of caution.ALL HARD DRIVES FAIL - SO REPLACE THEM BEFORE THEY DO:  Hard drives are complex mechanical devices. They will absolutely, inevitably fail.  So manage them accordingly.I replace all my drives after about three to four years (if they survive that long).  It's much easier to replace a drive before it fails - it's very easy to copy a readable drive.  It's much harder to recreate a drive, especially a boot drive, after it fails - you need to reinstall all the software and settings, and maybe reconstruct the folder structure.And hard drives are cheap enough to make it not worth the risk to keep drives around longer than that.  I can usually get a bigger, faster drive for much less money than the original drive.Once you start to accept the reality that hard drives will fail, and manage your drives and data appropriately, you can drastically reduce the disruption that hard drive failures cause.BUY A GOOD MODEL OF DRIVE, THEN KEEP A CURRENT BACKUP:  As much as people like to claim that particular brands are better or worse, statistics don't really seem to back that up.  Buy a good model from one of the top brands - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung - and then manage them as described above.That being said - some drives (or the firmware they are shipped with) have turned out to be real lemons.  Most of the big manufacturers make good drive models, and they have made bad drive models.  So much like your uncle, who never bought a new model car until they'd worked the bugs out of it - let someone else be at the bleeding edge of hard drives.  Buy models that have been tested by other users.It's a little soon to tell for the drive installed in this particular model, and some of the early feedback is mixed.COOLING QUESTIONS:  I can't really figure out why the cooling is so unconvincing on almost all external drives (like this one).  A tight-fitting plastic case, with no effective ventilation?  Really?  While drive temperature isn't perhaps quite as big an issue as some would make it out to be - that level of cooling just doesn't seem adequate for a drive that's running more than a fraction of the time.  If your needs fit that description - that is, if you need a back up drive, or an intermittently used expansion drive - then this Seagate external drive may be a good matchFOR AN INTENSIVELY USED EXPANSION DRIVE, CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS:  If you need more space in an expansion drive, and plan to use the drive intensively, consider other options.  Perhaps a NAS (network attached storage) or a drive enclosure with more effective cooling, and possibly something with multiple drives and built in backup.WATCH HOW YOUR DRIVES ARE SHIPPED:  One of the key factors in whether a drive will last is how it's handled and shipped.  External drives such as this one are usually packaged somewhat well, although online vendors still don't seem to really get the concept of filling the shipping box so the product inside doesn't bounce around on its way to you."}, {"review_id": "e7b500012099d7470044e6138caa83d2", "review": "Wow, I couldn't believe how fast I received it.I love you people there, I always get a confirmation email within minutes after purchasing that it has already shipped.The price was so much better than any place I looked.

Probably would be a good primary router as well, but I use it as a range extender. I now get 3 bars downstairs where I used to get zero signal, and 4 bars out on the deck.I wish I could say the set up was easy, but because my wifi router is 7 years old and was set to WEP security it wasn't the simplest to get it to work. I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again. No need to reconfigure anything.It's also quite small and sleek looking, so not an eyesore in the middle of the kitchen (the halfway point in my house).  I like it so much that when I decide to retire my old router I will definitely be getting a second one of these. It's signal is also not quite strong enough to cover my entire property with just one (has range of 100 ft), but with two of them I'll be in great shape.Special bonus, if you are a T-mobile cell user, you already know you can use your wifi connection to make calls and send texts/surf the web. So extending your wifi range to all of your property, not just where your computer is, will be even more worthwhile.  Just be sure to unplug all this wireless stuff when everyone goes to bed at night if you're going to amp up the coverage so that it's hitting the bedrooms too. You'll sleep better.

Sharp, detailed, good dynamic range. There are two issues I have with this camera, however. First off, it has a tendency to overexpose and clip highlights. Secondly, while it keeps noise at bay through ISO1600, it seems to do this through very aggressive noise reduction at ISO800 and beyond, taking a toll on fine detail. The Olympus XZ-2 on the other hand, has more noise at ISO800 but also more detail. Personally, I like cameras that retain fine detail better and don't mind a little noise. But to say that the RX100 is an open and shut case as far as IQ is concerned (when compared to its competitors)...not quite.I am not particularly thrilled about the F4.9 at the telephoto end but the lens has nice characteristics otherwise so I really don't see that as a negative overall. What is a negative overall is how long it takes for the lens to zoom in and out and it's loud when it does it.The autofocus performance on this camera is somewhat disappointing in low-light. It's fine in the daytime but in low-light it's almost as slow as the much less-expensive Powershot S100. Also I had issues with the image stabilization is not great on the camera for some reason. I found in a lot of instances that you had to hold onto the camera very tightly in order to get a blur-free shot. I think that is inexcusable for a $650 camera.Some people have commented on the battery life of this camera. It's not the greatest but that's one of the trade-offs you have to make with a small pocket camera. Your best bet is just to get an extra battery.The LCD screen on back is very nice being somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. The menu system on the camera is a very nice and more straight-forward than other Sony cameras that I've used. The dial up front doesn't have decisive clicks that the Powershot S100 has but it's still nice to have considering that some enthusiast cameras don't have it at all.Ergonomics-wise, I think this camera could use some improvement. The shiny metal body is slippery up front and could benefit from some sort of grip or textured surface to make the camera more secure in your hand.Video generally looks nice, I haven't tested it much. But it generally is sharp and the audio sounds good.I think the RX100 was a respectable first compact enthusiast camera for Sony. And indeed, it's remarkable they were able to take a relatively large sensor and put it in such a compact light-weight camera. It's image quality is a cut above any enthusiast compact out there. But it has some performance-related issues that need refinement. Not terrible, but it could have been better on a $650 camera. Overall though, a great first enthusiast compact from Sony."}, {"review_id": "63991ff7636d1b1af6dfd05e282c7fed", "review": "Up to now, advanced hobbyist photographers had to make a tradeoff between portability and quality.  No more. This camera can take shots as good -and sometimes better- as my trusted DSLR.Take a look at my sample shots at [...]PORTABILITYThis camera fits in my hand, in my pocket and in my laptop bag. In fact, I am using the case for my wife's Lumix TZ8. I can bring this camera with me anywhere.One big advantage is safety: if you travel to places that are not 100% safe, any potential robber would mistake it with a cheap $200 camera. More importantly, you will nevr have to leave this camera in a hotel room, on the trunk of your car, or will have to carry a big backpack with camera and accessories.Why this is size so important? You miss 100% of the shots you can't take because you cannot bring your camera. Because this is a camera you will carry anywhere. There have been many business trips, weekend opportunities and just in the moment photo opportunities where it was not practical or safe to bring my big DSLR. That is no longer a problem with a portable camera like this that gives me all the quality and control I need as an experienced photographer.The only downside to size it that it looks pretty ridiculous to have this camera mounted on a tripd (as I did last night taking skyline shots at dusk) and that you don't have the `professional' look of sdomeone carrying a large camera with a big lens, which sometimes is useful getting access to normally unavailable areas for tourists.QUALITYSony has been improving the quality of its digital cameras steadily for the last few years.  In February of 2011 I got a HX5V which was quite impressive, and delivered quality images even when compared with a DSLR except for low-light and other tricky situations. I traded it for a Canon PowerShot S95 which was a step ahead but still suffered from high noise levels in low light settings.What makes this camera unique is a 1\" CMOS sensor. It is the only camera in this class or in similar size with a sensor this big. The law of physics is very simple: larger sensor, higher quality and lower noise. Sure you could get a NEX-5 with an even bigger sensor for slightly better quality but you would be stuck with a much, much larger camera, especially because of the size of the lens, and a much higher price.Combined with a minimum aperture of f/1.8, Carl Zeiss optics and a lot of cool features from Sony such as the Auto HDR and very cool camera effects, it is an amazing camera. After a week of playing with it I am wondering why would the average person need anything more than this camera.Last, I really love the on-screen information (and the quality of the display), especially the level indicator that helps you shoot straight pictures.EASE OF USEDon't let the power scare you away from this camera. As most point and shoot cameras, this one has an `auto' mode that is usually quite good at getting the right settings for each shot. If you ar enot an expert, you will feel at home with the Sony RX100 camrea having used any pocket digital camera, and you will enjoy the high quality it delivers.I found the menus to be intuitive, the camera feels solid and built with high quality materials.AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTProcessing speed takes a few seconds, but given the quality of the effects I would be surprised if they took significantly less time. Still, often you have to wait a second or two after a shot if you use advanced in-camera processing such as HDR.The 3.6 Zoom goes to 105mm I think, which is fine for most situations but could be nice to have a 200mm 9equivalent) zoom. I know adding such a zoom would require a larger lens so I rather keep the portability as is. Further, with 20 megapixels, you can zoom in to your photos easily in post production.Overall, if you are an experienced hobbyist or a semi-professional photographer looking for a camera to take always with you, or a backup/alternative to your big clunky DSLR, don't look any further.

I replaced this a month ago, so time will tell how long this router lasts.Comparisions with the netgear nighthawk is that this is a little slower but hardly noticable. I wish TP-Link had USB3.0 instead of just USB 2.0. I found that TP-Link's firmware does a better job of identifying the distances of devices and adjusting power to the signal accordingly. Negear did not come close to this. I was around 50 feet away and would get a fair signal on netgear. With TP-link I have an excellent signal once it detects my laptop in the room that is further out. For power consumption Netgear Nighthawk I measured at eating about 10-15W. This runs nominally at 4-5 watts. I think the netgear's issue on power consumption is that it has a dual core 1 Ghz Processor.I will update my review as the months past and this router performs.

I am not going to regurgitate it all back to you again, instead I will go over what stood out and what I had problems with when using this router in my network.As far as what good things stood out the router has 3 external antennas that are detachable allowing you to upgrade the antennas if you want. I like having antenna options. There are dedicated wireless and power on / off switches on the rear of router allowing easy rebooting and absolute control over the wireless signal. I was able to achieve my rated download and upload speeds from my ISP. I did not have to reboot the router because it locked up. The router runs really cool to the touch. There are wall mount slots on the bottom of the router. overall things generally work like they should.As far as what bad things stood out to me the router has a shiny black finish making it a fingerprint and dust magnet. There are no rubber feet on the bottom and it has a tendency to slide around on my desk. I dislike the bright blue LEDs that are angled up on the front panel.  I only need to see what is up at a quick glance directly at the router. I don't need the router to be constantly attracting my attention even when I am not directly looking at it. I don't like the fact that I can't see all LAN and Wireless clients along with their MAC and IP Addresses listed on a page. The wireless signal strength is not as strong as that from my Netgear WNDR3700v1.  Placing my cell phone back in my bedroom in the same exact spot swapping the routers in the same spot on my desk and measuring the signal using Wi-Fi Analyzer I measured the following:TP-Link 2.4GHz -76 dBm and 5GHz -88dBm vs Netgear 2.4GHz -65 dBm and 5GHz -84dBm.So my older Netgear with internal antennas seemed to have a better signal between those spots. I also had this weird problem where I had a Seagate Wireless Plus drive connected to the router via wireless. When I would do file transfers from a wired PC on the network to the Seagate drive the other devices on the network (wired or wireless) would slow to a crawl. I haven't gotten to the bottom of what that problem was yet so it could be the drive or the router at this point. I will have to do further testing in the future.I did not have a problem setting up the router. I have been through a lot of routers in my time. If you are new to configuring a router you may need some help figuring out what does what. Each page has a help section to the right of it. It is nice that it is there but you sometimes get that problem with a not so smooth translation to English so you aren't quite sure what they mean. You can figure most things out but some things are tough because of the translation and limited info.Overall not the most impressive router in my eyes but it is OK. I have had to test routers before that just wouldn't function for any period of time, at least this one can perform its core functions while maybe not near the top of what I would hope for, at least it does it reliably. Remember too that routers are a moving target with firmware updates, some things might get better and some things might get worse in the future. If you can get one for the right price it might be worth a look to you if you are in the market for a router.Update: I removed a complaint about no guest wireless. As support pointed out to me in the comments a new firmware came out after I started using the router to review it. The new firmware has guest networks for wireless along with several other fixes and improvements. So as I said a moving target and things can get better.

This router definitely falls in that category."}, {"review_id": "9acef0e17eb1f5dbf6d1e23d06a04ed8", "review": "Every now and then you come across a product that brings a smile to your face and this could turn out to be one of them. I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles."}, {"review_id": "9a7b03d2a5e21365995af9762be9a982", "review": "The speedy version:Pros:-Easy setup.-Reliable connection point for a variety of devices.-Works as a USB printer server.-Designed to sit on a desk or hang on a wall (it has keyholes on the back).Cons:-Compared to our previous routers, I haven't found one downside to this router.Result:- I will recommend this to family and friendsLonger story:We have been using an Apple Time Capsule as our wifi router since 2008.  It was going well, until it melted down (known problem).  I removed the hard disk and we used it as a router only, with less overheating.  That lasted a few weeks until I started hearing panicked hollers from all corners of our condo.  Sure enough, it was time to replace our router.We wound up with the TP-LINK WDR3500.Set up was very easy, using the web browser based interface.We were back up and surfing on all of our devices in around 30 minutes from the arrival of the box until I entered the last password into the last iDevice.Not too bad.  I did set up two different networks though, so the folks who are playing can use one band and the other is used by me.So far everything has been great.  I did have to go through setup once again, after a power outage, but it was even faster than the initial set up, due to familiarity on my part.Right now we have two tablets, an ipod touch, an ailing and ancient macbook, a macmini, an XO/OLPC laptop (linux), a smartphone, and our vonage service all connecting through the TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 without any hiccups.  For the first time in years, I have a reliable wireless connection to my other computer (perfect for when it's monitor croaked) and it has been almost 2 months and my mom hasn't complained about the sound quality when she calls us and it was always an issue (for her) when our vonage box and phones were routed through the Time Capsule.There is only one USB port.  That's not an issue for us.  I did have some trouble getting my Seagate Slim drive to connect and function as a network drive, but because the connection is so seamless and reliable, I have my Labelwriter printer connected to the USB port and I hooked up a larger USB hub to the macmini which I then connected to the router.  That way I can still access everything, but it also gives me an extra layer of protection as the router requires one password and the computer another.I was upset when our Time Capsule petered out, but this router made the transition a positive one and I think I'm done with Time Capsule, but I'd recommend this to friends and family without hesitation."}, {"review_id": "1ea258dd59c0140fb2ccd25b974d6692", "review": "This is the router I'm currently using in my home as a wireless access point.

For the most part the router served me well enough to not want to replace it.  There were occasional instances in which the router would drop the connection during internet surfing or more importantly online game play, but I chalked it up as having to do with my ISP instead of my equipment.  Also sometimes this router would get in a funky state and i would be unable to connect to my DSL modem but that was resolved by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and turning it back on.  These issues were annoying but minor and infrequent occurrences.  I have tried other routers such as D-link and Netgear, but I did not like the interface enough to replace my trusty old Linksys.  I recently got the opportunity to get a new router from a company I never heard of before, TP-Link and I figured why not?Off the bat, I would like to say I do like the updated look of this router.  The glossy black finish and the large indicator lights on the front is a big upgrade in look from my 10 year old Linksys router.Looks aside, when I first got this router, honestly, I wasn't too confident that would would be as good as my Linksys, but I decided to give it a chance and if all else failed I could always go back to the Linksys.  However after using it for about a month I am very impressed with my new router and its features that are not present on my Linksys.  Since using this router I have not experienced any disconnections during online game play and while I won't say its \"faster\", my online games seem to play much smoother than before.I did really want to setup the TP-Link using the CD because of past experiences with using included CD's to set hardware up, but in hindsight the CD Setup was great and did not cause much issue at all.  After setting up the router using the CD and trying to connect to the internet for the first time, my ISP directed me to their page to setup a new username and password to use with the router.  I thought this for sure would cause an issue, but it didn't which was a relief.  To make things even better after the setup process was complete the router created a .txt document that listed all my settings, username/password and network keys for future use.Another thing I like about the TP-Link router is that the interface is just as if not more intuitive and user friendly as my Linksys was.  One of the things I disliked about the Netgear and D-link routers was that the interface was terrible making simple things hard to find and simple tasks harder to do than it should have been.  With the TP-Link router interface, every menu is easy to find and its functions are clearly explained.A couple of features I like about the TP-Link are the Dual band capability and the USB port on the back of the router which allows you to connect a USB device such as a printer or a External Hard drive for all computers on the network to share.  Neither of these features were present on my Linksys.I originally wasn't going to use the Dual Band setup but since it was so easy to set up and configure I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out.  I have my laptop, cell phone, and my son's 3DS connected to the 2.4GHZ network, while I have my XBOX and PS3 connected to the 5GHz network.  Since using this new configuration I haven't had any disconnections on my XBOX or PS3 while playing them online.  As I said before when disconnections occurred in the past I thought it was my ISP, but now I haven't had any disconnections since, maybe it WAS my old router that was the culprit.The feature I really like is the shared USB feature.  There is a USB port on the back of the router that you can connect a USB device to that can be shared across your network.  Since my printer was already shared over my network, I decided to use this port to connect my external hard drive so I could perform my system backups more easily.  Prior to this setup, I was using Buffalo Link stations and Drive stations for my backups which didn't always work properly (especially with the LinkStation) so I ended up slacking off on backing up because it became too much trouble.  However now with the USB share feature backups are as easy as connecting the USB drive to the router and mapping a network drive on each computer to that device.  Backups for me are extremely easy and I can do them every night without any issue.  I have noticed that the transfer speed during my backups seems to be slower than they were with my Linkstation, however since my backups are usually done at night when no one is on the computer this doesn't bother me too much.In conclusion, since using this new router I don't even know its there which is a good thing.  The transition from using my Linksys router to the TP-Link was smooth and mostly painless. One star deduction for the slow transfer speeds, but other than that no big issues. I still have my Linksys in case things change, but I am hoping that the TP-Link gives me many years of service as my old router did."}, {"review_id": "9c6fb4480e8f179cf1ea7cb0c5e1986c", "review": "Used this for 6 months, using both bands as well as the Gigabit ports, very reliable, no reboot, no reset.

I had never before heard of TP-Link.  Because this router is available for less than $70, I had real reservations on just how well it would do in a real working environment.I was pleasantly surprised to find out from a performance standpoint, there was not much difference from the \"big names.\"  After EASY set-up, I began using the router in my small insurance agency.  I didn't tell my Office Manager I had changed routers.  I waited for her reaction.  She never even noticed the difference between the TP-Link N600 and our previous Netgear WNDR4500 which, incidentally, was double the price.The wireless performance of the N600 router turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Even though the router is less than half the cost of some of the \"big name\" routers, there is no lacking of performance whatsoever.  You may not like the look of a router with its external antennas, but there is no doubt the router utilizes the design effectively.  The speed is outstanding and the range is exceptional.All in all, TP-Link N600 comes equipped with ALMOST every major function you could want from a router.  It is MISSING a 'Guest Network' feature which allows you to have separate security and access restrictions for guests accessing your network.  Other than that, I believe this router can certainly compete with the \"big names.\"Adding to my satisfaction, the TP-Link N600 comes complete with a 2-year limited warranty.The TP-Link N600 is a very impressive dual-band router that performs like the \"big names\" but costs about half the price.  It doesn't have the most attractive interface, but it isn't lacking many features.  Those looking for a best buy for the money, the TP-Link N600 is really hard to beat."}, {"review_id": "9b33ceb4e50031b7476208788d114b50", "review": "Summary:  This is a good router at the price, with decent speed and lots of extras.  It took a while to set up, but it's so feature packed that I have a tough time deciding between this and my old router (a more expensive Netgear WNDR3700).What's good:- It has dual band 2.4 and 5.0 ghz data, which lets you run your older devices on 2.4, then reserve 5.0 for video streaming and data intensive uses.  The speed is good.  Downloads go great, and I can watch HD video over the internet without a hiccup.- It has two usb ports that you can use to hook a usb printer, hard drive, or even data stick to your local area network or even to set up an internet enabled ftp server.- The administration page is pretty straightforward, and comes with a lot of features, like parental controls or \"QoS,\" a feature that lets you allocate more bandwidth to your more important applications.- If you're into third party firmware, it looks like it's compatible with openwrt and dd-wrt, although I haven't tried it, so use with caution.- After upgrading to the newest firmware, this is the most customizeable router I've seen.-- With the new firmware, it does have a guest mode, which allows my house guests to get on the net without accessing my LAN or getting a password.  Better yet, this router allows me to limit the amount of bandwidth available to guests!  I'm not that mean, but I appreciate the option.  ;-)-- The firmware allows me to adjust the wireless width on the 2.4 gHz channel - the first time I've ever seen that, and I'm looking forward to see if it increases range and throughput.What could be better:- Even after maximizing wireless width, this still doesn't have as much range as I hoped.  It's good in my house, but the 2.4 range is still weak in my yard, compared to my previous router.- One very minor complaint is that the router is not very attractive - big antennae and an angry blueberry salad of blinking lights make this look like something that should be hidden in a closet someplace.Set-up tips:- I didn't have much luck with the mini-cd, but opening a browser window to the administration page (192.168.0.1) got me in with no trouble, and the \"quick setup\" did most of what I needed.- TP-Link recommends a complete powerdown after setting up.  Power down your cable modem, router, and computer, wait two minutes, then power them on in the same order, waiting for each one to boot fully before starting the next one.  After I did that, it worked without a hitch.- I'm running firmware version 3.13.31, released March 9, 2013.It took me a good half hour to set up the way I wanted, but now I like it quite a bit.

My standard model right now is theLinksys EA4500 App-Enabled N900 Dual-Band Wireless-N Router with Gigabit and USBand this compares pretty nicely at a lower price point.Setup was relatively simple once I figured out the user interface which is one area EA4500 is better but my fiance watched as if a deer in headlights.  I think there is a market out there for a router company to develop a name for having the easiest simple set up and TP-Link and Linksys (despite their self proclaiming) are not those companies.  Once set up, features were not as robust as the Linksys and the one I really wanted was the ability to set up a guest connection since we often have house guests.  The Linksys also has the ability to recognize and prioritize devices but I end up needing that less than I thought I would.Performance was solid.  We have Webpass internet service (highly recommended) with speeds of 100mbs upload and download and this router did very well.  On the 5.0 ghz band, the wireless signal did not travel quite as far as the linksys but still made it throughout the primary 12 foot radius of the router.Overall I would probably go with this TP-Link if I had to buy all over again."}, {"review_id": "4dd8e55c7f19cb818cc2a7bd1e30824e", "review": "Purchased this router to replace an existing Netgear AP that was getting unreliable, with hopes of better range.

That was a very easy process.Pros:The user management interface is very nice and user friendly.Performance is amazing! I have it hooked up to a static gateway, which splits up my modem's connection to two other routers. The bandwidth tests I have ran over WiFi with the Asus are showing higher speeds on average than the other router which the PC's are physically connected to via Ethernet. That alone is pretty impressive. It'ss also very reliable and I haven't had any problems with it till this point. Still early, but only time will tell. The WiFi range is very strong. Two previous wireless N routers did not even come close to the range I am getting with the Asus. And even at the edge of the range, the bandwidth is still decent.Cons:Some parts in the QOS section were a little confusing, but Asus support was able to clear up the confusion for me after an email. This is really not a con because they just verified what I was assuming anyway, but I wanted to ask the questions to be sure.Price was a bit high, but other high end routers are in the same price range.I would highly recommend this router for those looking for a highend, wireless router.

Since I upgraded the firmware to 220, I have already rebooted the router about 4~5x, the internet connection suddenly stops. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel that the router is a bit warmer when I touch it using firmware 220. I don't have any temperature measuring device so I can't confirm that it's really warmer (I did not adjust the transmit power setting, fyi).Update (9/12/12):I updated the firmware to version 3.0.0.4.220, and the 2 previous problems I stated is still existing.. I don't mind it that much but I still hope Asus fixes it soon. Workaround for 1.) I connect my PC to 2.4Ghz. 2.) I use Splashtop from my iPhone to connect to my home PC from office.AiCloud looks promising, supposedly you could view/play your media files from your iphone/ipad and android devices within and outside your network. But I'm stuck with the loading page, after I put my login user and password. My iphone can't login. Can anyone confirm if the aicloud works?Update (8/30/12):So far have encountered 2 problems with the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.164)1. I'm using Nero Media Home 4 in my PC to share my media to my wireless TV, Bluray and PS3. When my PC is connected to 5Ghz, the tv, bluray and ps3 cannot connect to Nero. When I connect to 2.4Ghz, they can see Nero and play the media. This works fine with N66U.2. I have setup port forwarding for Remote Desktop Connection, so I can connect to my home PC from my office. It's not working. This again, is working fine with N66U.QOS is also a known problem, but I'm not using it for now. I believe it's just a firmware issue since both are working with N66U. I hope it gets fixed with the next firmware release.Original Review:I bought this to share my media files, from an external hard drive, to my 3d tv and wireless bluray in bedroom. So far I'm not disappointed. I also have N66U to compare with, I've read from other reviewers that this router gets hot, when I touch the top part, it is warm but not hot, which is the same with my N66U.This is suppose to have a greater coverage compare to N66, but to my experience, the coverage is the same, which is already awesome.Initial setup was very straightforward, easy, fast and CD-less. Below are the actual steps after opening the box:1. Connect LAN cable from modem, LAN cable going to PC, and power cable2. Open web browser. Router setup page automatically shows up. Click Next3. Type the User login and Password that you want. Click Next4. Type the SSID and key for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz (or you can click the checkbox: Copy 2.4Ghz settings to 5Ghz settings). Click Apply.After that, your wireless device should now be able to connect to your new router. I even used the same SSID and password from my previous router, and my devices connected automatically after the setup.These are my devices that connects to this router:- 3 laptops- 2 Iphones- Ipad- wireless tv- wireless bluray- PS3- wireless printerNo problem with connections, no disconnects, iphones when outside the apartment are still connected.PROS- Media Bridge mode. Applicable using 2 AC66U. This feature is not available to N66U- Dual band, 450Mbps+1300Mbps. I can't comment with the AC speeds, I don't have wireless AC clients for now.- HTTPS authentication when accessing admin page. If your using this for office/business use, this is plus.- AiCloud. Coming soon, the app is not yet available from the appstore/googleplay as of this review. (This is now available as of firmware version 3.0.0.4.220)- 2 USB ports. Supports external hard drives, printers or 3g/4g modems- 3TB external harddrive works (Manual says only up to 2TB is supported). Tested using Seagate expansion 3TB STBV3000100. My TVs won't even accept 3TB harddrives when connected directly to its usb ports.- DHCP Manual IP assignment (if you need static private IP on your device)- DLNA. Streams HD vids, pics and 3D vids to my LG tv and my LG bluray player, no lags, no disconnects. And this is even using wireless connection and not wired.- Awesome range. Before, I was using a cheap netgear, single band 2.4Ghz, included from my ISP. From the farthest point in my apartment, I get 2 bars of signal in windows 7 wireless network connection settings. With AC66U, I get full 5 bars using 2.4Ghz, and 4 bars on the 5Ghz band.- 3 Large external antennas- Download Master (if your into P2P downloading/uploading)- Option to vertically stand the router, or wall mount- User friendly setup- Impressive performance particularly on 5Ghz band- Stylish looks and superb quality- Ability to install 3rd party firmwaresCONS- Steep price (but worth it!)- Lack of USB 3.0 (not a big deal, since I don't get usb 2.0 speeds for file transfer using FTP or Samba, which I already know before purchasing this)- Manual is a bit helpful, but this router has tons of features and the manual only mentions the basic functionalities.If you got the money, and want a great performing router and stylish as well, I Highly Recommend Asus RT-AC66U. If you're about to buy N66U, just add $20~30 to your budget, and get this router, you won't regret."}, {"review_id": "7d06ed6c0f6bd3c7c3b45c2b3b7c07cc", "review": "asuswrt is by far the best firmware for this router right now, unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because it lacks the features and customization I've grown to love from tomato (shibby in particular) and dd-wrt.  That said, the performance is excellent and I recommend this over it's n66u cousin.  One of the (two) wireless interfaces on this is a newer broadcom chip with more features that the twin interfaces on the n66u, so even if you don't use ac (yet), you still have a better chip at your disposal.  Unfortunately, going back to the firmware problem, you can't squeeze or customize much out of the new chip with the current firmware and lack of third party offerings, which you currently can with the n66u.just for example, the default tx power, as listed by wl, is 1500 (!) mw (using the latest asuswrt firmware).  That is about 1480 more than I'd like.  Thanks to a user named Merlin, we can download a modified version of asuswrt and customize settings beyond the webinterface, and in using it, I can set the power properly, as well as a bunch of other features (iptables droplists, upnpd custom settings, dnsmasq custom settings, hosts file, cron jobs, and more).  Even by setting the txpower to a sane setting through the webinterface, BTW, it still defaults to 1500 (or 1496ish) for some mysterious reason.  Atleast as reported by wl (the main configuration and settings program published by Broadcom).As for performance, I am very pleased.  I can break 300Mbps using an tri band N adapter w/o problem.  Also pleased with the stability.  Just wish shibby could implement the key features (speed speed speed) of asuswrt firmware into his code so I can use some of those terrific features and bypass the hideous default/stock webinterface.In short, this is a terrific router for the coming years.  At the moment however, the n66u with tomato shibby firmware is probably better.  That said, I don't regret paying the price to be forward compatible.  I'm lacking a few features I'd like to implement but the performance (speed) has been terrific and stable."}], "B008AST7R6": [{"review_id": "ff2bd8e0dfe5e3c065a1a2019e680a6b", "review": "Keeps the grease and fingerprints away for sure!

The monitor is packaged very well and arrived as expected.  There are good reviews on it.  Let me add a few things that I never saw listed.This is my fifth IPS monitor purchased in the last eight years.  I don't waste my time on TN glass.  Several things led me to the purchase of the Asus monitor: Overall good reviews, no coating smudges and the color gamut, and the USB 3.0 ports.  I considered the PA246Q monitor for a few more dollars but chose this one for the USB ports.It worked perfectly out of the box and the first noticable difference was the color.  It is incredible and it puts the colors on my old Gateway FPD2485W monitor to shame.  They run next to each other, the Gateway turned up for vertical use.  The Asus also runs much cooler - warm to the touch and nothing close to the Gateway furnace.  I suspect that it the LED that makes the difference.It had some unexpected surprises.  First, the bezel surrounding the screen is smaller.  The stand is well built and very sturdy. The monitor cannot wiggle around.  You can read about the ports.  And it has the picture-in-picture feature of the Asus 246Q monitor; somethingthat is not listed in Amazon's description of the product.  Better yet, I plugged in my USB 3.0 portable hard drive; it powered up easily and my computer quickly recognized it.  I used it all day with no problems.  I had not expected that.Setup is easy.  The colors are accurate.  I love the 5-way rocker switch.  I love the different adjustments it allows.  I suppose if there is a downside it would be that it is extremely bright even at the lowest settings.  But my aging eyes see it well and I am getting used to it.  White leans toward the blue part of the spectrum (LED again) but changing colors does not affect the white color or the black.  A black background on your screen seems \"shiny\" and deep compared to flatter monitors but it is easily covered with a dark grey or light black background.  The colors are so fantastic one might as well use photos instead.At 6ms refresh, there is no noticable ghosting in games.  That is pretty quick for an IPS monitor.  And again the colors make the game so much more immersive.Considering the fact that I spent over $600 on my last IPS monitor, I am going to buy another one and run them side by side.  My only disappointment was that Amazon lowered the price by $45 the day after it arrived.  Talk about bad luck.  Still, it is a great deal.

I've ordered my fair share of displays through Amazon over the years and have always done so confidently as their return policy and procedure is fantastic. I am glad to say I have no reason to return this display.Again, the display is very sturdy and solid. The elevation mechanism is true and the rotation works perfectly, though I will probably be mounting it sooner or later on one of my Ergotrons. Lastly, I love the bezel. I prefer a nice thin bezel and this one looks great. Perfect for a multi-monitor set-up.FTR, I am using it with a late 2012 Mac Mini in a Dual Display configuration.EDIT: Two more things:1) As far as light bleed is concerned, when the black screensaver comes on I do see bleed on the corners as is common with this kind of monitor. During use, however, I have yet to notice anything at all. It only seems to be an issue when the screen is dark which it never is in my workflow. YMMV.2) I have a hard time using some LED-lit monitors including a Viewsonic that my wife recently got. The text is constantly shifting around and the whole thing bothers my eyes.

The stand swivels and rotates, so that you can use it in portrait mode if you so choose.  Little notches on the base tell you the angle that the monitor is at.  I don't know how often I'm going to use this feature, but it's nice to have.The screen looks great next to my older, non-IPS monitors.  They all look dark and bluish in comparison.

No annoying reflections from lights in the room.The USB ports are a nice feature.

The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera.

I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as \"light bleed\" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its \"stereo\" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.I'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well. I would recommend it to my friends but I also would suggest that they might want to research more and and maybe check out the Toshiba Excite or other brands and come to their own conclusions."}], "B008NMCPTQ": [{"review_id": "c9f6d884812adfe6db5fb158b7c5917e", "review": "PRO:* protects my tablet* easy to put the tablet in the case* magnets activate/deactivate tablet correctly* buttons, ports, and speakers are not blockedCON:* the multi-fold cover is sometimes hard to keep in place when reading one-handed* the angle of the stand is not acute enough for actual usage (though it's good for watching videos)"}, {"review_id": "c026a6dc13ddcdc1287d1edcb3fc1886", "review": "I have a few other cases from Poetic and they are very predictable with their quality.

My only complaint is that the angle it props up at is fairly vertical... I wish it either leaned back a little more, or gave you the option of more than one position.

I have had three keyboards.  First was the Apple keyboard and as great as it is, it definitely is not easily transportable.  Best kept in a stationary location.  I also have a recently purchased keyboard that folds up.  Meets the test of transportability, but quite frankly doesn't feel comfortable and has certain awkward key locations.  The other keyboard I purchased was for my original IPad and it attached to make a nice package to carry around.  However, the weak part for me was that the keyboard never felt comfortable, Keys were cramped.  Not that easy to type on.  I found the ad for this product and couldn't resist the purchase.  Turns out to be a hands down winner.  Looks and feels as a keyboard  should. Very solid feel to it.  Came neatly packaged in a neoprene carry pouch with a charging cable, albeit a bit short in length.  Was very easy to link via Bluetooth to my iPad and manages to stay linked each time I begin to use it.  The keyboard layout was perfect.  The keys really look and act as keyboard keys should.  Far superior for me than most of the other keyboards I have used.  Have not had the keyboard long enough to comment on battery life, but charging is rather simple, so not an issue.  Lastly, really meets the test of transportability as it easily attaches to my new iPad.  Attaching the keyboard to the iPad when carrying it is a cinch as is removing it for use.  The neoprene carrypouch fits the ipad and keyboard thus acting as a protective cover when carrying it around.  There are many ways to set it up.  I will leave that up to you to find the one that works best for you.  I had great fun typing this review using features to cut, paste, etc.If you have need for a really neat and efficient keyboard that is both useful when left in a stationary location or easily transportable as a single unit with your iPad then this is the one for you.  I would stronly recommend you buy this one.  You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "9265efd256e6ba7d23e8bf53317def20", "review": "UPDATE:  I've had this case on my ipad mini for several months now and I use it EVERY day.  It has held up perfectly, absolutely no issues with battery or keystrokes.  It had kept my ipad safe and very functional.  The multilayer protection allows you to really take advantage of travelling with your ipad.  The entire ipad is protected- this includes the screen, all ports, sides, front and back.Overall, I would highly recommend the Air Bender Mini. The quality of the keyboard and the protection it creates are great. Blue tooth works great! Immediate response and connects quickly once initially paired.-The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipad.-Charges quickly and charge seems to last a long time.-The keyboard is nice and very responsive, all keys work well and it has very nice options and extra keys. The ipad becomes a lot easier to use since you don't have to switch back and forth from numbers, letters, symbols etc.-The keyboard is sturdy and it looks like it will last a long time.-When system is closed, it creates a lot of protection for the ipad.Possible improvements:Out of the box instructions are not too clear. I didn't know if the plastic hardcover was an additional screen saver or just a place holder while in the box. I tried to put it on top of the ipad but it didn't click into place. A suggestion would be to put a sticker with some instruction such as &#34;remove&#34; or &#34;screen protector&#34;There are no clear instructions on how to install the actual ipad into the top sleeve. I figured it out easily enough, but it took some playing around. Fortunately, I had the time and curiosity, but I can see somebody in a hurry becoming frustrated.There are many options for moving/adjusting/removing the screen, but no instructions/demonstration. You can move it horizontal, vertical, slanted, straight, tilted, it can slide in and out of the back for more options but it takes a lot of experimenting with. I was a little afraid I would end out breaking it before I actually got to use it. It's a shame that it's so versatile but not if you don't figure it out.Another example is the function on the back; the camera lens type thing is a little tricky to figure out. You can't really get a good grip on it and I always seem to drop it not knowing what exactly I did to release the mechanism. I have small fingers, and I can't seem to have enough room to grasp both sides to release it. Once you figure out the function, it great that the ipad can just come off the keyboard protected in a skin when you don't want to use the keyboard.When the ipad is attached, and if you are working on your lap -it always wants to fall back, seems to be top heavy and unless you are typing -you kind of need to hold it so it doesn't fall backwards. On the long view setting, even more top heavy while on a lap, almost impossible to work with the keyboard.Update: I tested the keyboard this morning on a table and it functions very well. The top heavy issue from the lap use is completely gone on the horizontal view and the long view. The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipadI am one to always put a screen saver, then a cover of some form on all my ipods, ipads, etc. This contraption is nice in that it definitely protects the ipad from water, dust, bumps, drops etc. I feel comfortable that my ipad is safe but aesthetically it is not very appealing. Possible some colors or patterns would be nice.A nice addition to the package or to sell as an accessory would be maybe a dual head cable\\splitter where one could charge the ipad and the keyboard at the same time if one wished rather than having 2 cables and needing 2 plug ins.***The instructions and the aesthetic value could use some work but overall the form and function work great. I would highly recommend this product for somebody who is looking for a keyboard. The quality and function far exceeds the aesthetic issues with the product."}, {"review_id": "dbb3ada90c6b2979bfa941f47e3289c8", "review": "Devices tested on: iPad MiniI have used a Targus Versavu with keyboard with my standard iPad for a couple years now. So I was interested in testing out another company&#8217;s product with my iPad Mini.Getting the iPad Mini properly mounted was a bit of a chore, with it being a ruggedized case. I have used ruggedized cases, with keyboards, before with iPad and iPhone devices, soe I knew a few tricks to getting the case fitted around properly, although, getting the last bit of case properly fit into the home button section took a little work. The online video link included in the paperwork was a good resource for novices.I like that the keyboard charging is done through a standard style cable. In this case a micro USB connection. Good, because in case the included cable ever gets lost, those cables are easy to find. Charging the unit was very straight-forward, with the LED indicators. I followed the recommended initial charging time of 4 hours.Next was syncing the keyboard via Bluetooth. This was straight-forward process, especially if you have done this before with iOS devices. Instructions included in the paperwork were easy to follow. I was pleased with the responsiveness of the keyboard when typing. It felt natural, and the keyboard feels very durable, especially with it being a ruggedized case. There was also a clip on the front, to help keep the case closed, so it cannot accidentally open.When using the case, it is nice to be able to use the screen in either a portrait or landscape view. I do wish it was able to set into the case at a larger angle for viewing, while using it on a table. The Targus Versavu set at a nice angle for having on a table when typing. The arm that holds the iPad can be adjusted a bit for the viewing angle, but gravity with bring it down some over time. I like that if the keyboard is not needed, you can rotate and fold the screen against the keyboard, so that it can be held somewhat comfortably.The aspects of being a ruggedized case are well designed. the covers for the ports are fairly durable, and should last well over lots of use. Other ruggedized cases have had a cover over the camera, that you need to peel and move out of the way. This case leaves the camera exposed, and I really like that feature, because on some cases, that flap can pop back and disrupt the use of the camera. I like that in spots near the corners of my Targus Versavu that wore thru the felt material, this case does not have any materials I can observe will have the same issue.I think users that use their iPad mini a lot outdoors, would find this case quite useful in protecting their unit from dirt, water, and the elements. In general, anyone who finds themselves using their iPad outside, or transporting it in and out of vehicles would appreciate the durable design and function. Even if attached to a mount in a vehicle, like for law enforcement or delivery vehicles, it would work quite well.Product Rating on scale of 1 - 5: 5"}, {"review_id": "69a84c2982b24270dca0cf9b198b89ec", "review": "This is a very sturdy, elegant and functional Bluetooth keyboard case for your iPad Mini. It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Mini in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it's pretty heavy, much more so than some other such case/keyboard that are on the market right now. If you are looking for a very light accessory for your iPad Mini then this case is not for you. The case is also pretty hard to open up and insert your iPad Mini into. You need to pull back the rubberized outer cover, and then carefully pry open several small plastic hinges. You will probably not want to take your iPad Mini in and out too often.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Mini almost completely, including the plastic screen cover. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Mini from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are covered with rubberized plugs, but they are easily pulled back and allow the ports to be easily accessed with chords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Mini very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use.  The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is VERY cramped, and you really don't want to be using it for composing longer documents.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. However, only the portrait and the landscape orientations will be useful for the most part. I found the landscape orientation to be unstable though - I either had to allow the iPad Mini to \"dangle\" above the keyboard, or pull it out so far that the connecting arm becomes detached. If you are planning on typing in an on-the-go situation far away from a desk, then all of this is less than optimal.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model.

I really do. While I don't get into the realm of the insanely expensive professional monitors, I really appreciate a good IPS/PLS monitor. And here's another one.Surprisingly, getting the monitor out of the box wasn't as easy as I'd have hoped. The stem of the monitor (the part that attaches to the stand) is sort of wedged (gently!) against a piece of foam, so it took a little bit of wiggling to get the screen out. If you have someone to help, this would go much more easily!Putting the monitor on the stand took just a few seconds. It hand-screws in, and has a very solid base. It's also an extremely ugly, huge base, and absolutely my one major gripe with the monitor.But let's focus on the good stuff first:For reference, this was tested on a 2011 MacBook Air via mini-Displayport to Displayport (2560x1440), and with a Google Chromecast via HDMI (1920x1080).1.) Pre-calibrated out of the box. Given that my screen came with a specific-to-this-serial-number piece of paper documenting the factory calibration, I was extremely impressed with the output.2.) The controls on the bottom right of the screen are touch sensitive. Normally I'm not a fan of such buttons, but these are without a doubt the most responsive touch-buttons I've used on a monitor. Really good stuff.3.) The screen isn't matte, and it isn't glossy. It's a really excellent combination of the two, cutting down on the glare of a glossy display, while maintaining those rich colors and good contrast.4.) Viewing angles, like many/most IPS panels, is truly excellent.5.) Able to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and it does line up perfectly straight when locked into that 90-degree position. Also, the height adjustment is superb, with plenty of height for me, and I'm 6'5\".6.) No dead/stuck pixels on the monitor I received. Good!7.) No PWM-dimming flicker (if you're sensitive to this, you'll be glad to know!), and no buzzing or other untoward noises from the display at any brightness.8.) While certainly not specifically a gaming monitor, it definitely holds its own. My gaming monitor of choice is myEIZO Foris FS2333-BK 23-Inch Screen LCD Monitor, but if you want something bigger without the viewing-angle deficiencies of TN panels, this would not be a bad choice for the less hardcore PC gamers among you. I wouldn't recommend it for 1080p gaming since the scaling to 1440p can be quite ugly.9.) You can turn off the blue power LED when the monitor is in use, from the Settings menu. I really don't like unnecessary LEDs, so this is something I immediately looked for and was glad to find.And now, the cons:1.) The base of the stand is horrible. I'm not sure what Viewsonic were thinking, but surely somebody could have come up with something a little less of an eyesore. I'll be mounting the screen on a VESA mount (100x100), but still - ouch! So ugly, and it takes up a huge amount of room on the desk for no apparent reason.2.) The brightness is set far, far too high out of the box (maxed out). All this did was draw attention to a little light bleed on the left of my particular display, only view-able on a completely black image. After the brightness was turned down to a less eye-searing level, this was (mostly) gone.Overall, though, this is a top-notch monitor, and highly recommended.5 stars out of 5."}, {"review_id": "11fb878d664e1e00f6043475eb1980a6", "review": "First of all, I went from an old 21&#34; Samsung monitor to this 27&#34; 1440 display.

That is where I believe this monitor shines.  Photos are vivid and the colors are great, I did not have to make any adjustments to the factory settings.  I have plenty of real estate to open the photo and have my editing tools open beside it without feeling like I'm running out of room or having to zoom in and out.  Great!  Playing games is awesome, I did not notice any blurring or shadowing, but I'm not a hard core gamer.  I just play an occasional game.

I would highly recommend this TV."}, {"review_id": "716094f88d8a959cf8c908cdab8ebd58", "review": "The picture is pretty GOOD. I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv."}, {"review_id": "32a06fa9c410b3b6e6e74ef4f3b8fa7b", "review": "Great size and price for secondary TV.

I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic \"foot\" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.  The Sony Blu-ray player I hooked up the Vizio TV has a browser, so the lack of a browser in the TV set itself wasn't a big deal for me, but I wish it were clearer in the product description (references to Internet and WiFi led me to assume I could get onto the Internet from the TV).Bottom line:  A very good quality picture, OK sound, with built-in wifi and easy-to-use apps, all for around two fifty make this an exceptional value.  An excellent choice in this size class."}, {"review_id": "28480beedb8b6c838d192ccf63ede7ef", "review": "As Amazon consolidates reviews for various models in the same product line, please note that this is a review of the Vizio E320i-A0.If you purchase this TV it will bring you frustration.  The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's \"Vizio Internet Apps Plus\" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a \"dumb\" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, \"M-GO\" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a \"revolutionary\" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all \"pay\" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not \"revolutionary\" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this \"smart\" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.  The entire experience is really bizarre.Ultimately, the greatest disappointment of the E320i-A0 is its abysmal UI and limited apps, which Vizio flatly informed me it has no intention to update to its current \"VIA Plus\" interface.  Again, the TV is good in terms of picture, size, sound and inputs, but the \"smart\" content is worthless.  If you buy this TV you will be stuck with the lousy UI, crappy remote, and crippled apps.  Be forewarned, and get a \"dumb\" TV and a Roku (or Chromecast, or XBox 360, etc); you'll be much happier you did."}], "B0097BEECI": [{"review_id": "97845fdc36d1dfd131a5e70e9774caa2", "review": "I absolutely love my shuffle.

It was everything I wanted and needed. Anyways, I had watched the keynote in September 2012, thinking \"No matter what, I'm keeping my old iPod touch\". By the end of the presentation, I was drooling over the new one. So, I sold my 4th gen. and bought this one in December 2012. Best choice ever.Upgrades over Fourth Generation:Build: It is so sleek compared to the 4th gen. I love the feel, and the \"squarer\" sides make it easier to hold and press the volume and power buttons. It is slightly harder to rest in my hand (my pinky acts as the support), but I attribute that to not having a case. It will wobble the tiniest bit, but having the loop button pushed out when flat helps to stabilize it. Also, the loop strap gives me more control when using one hand (and that is still easy, if not better with my longer fingers).-----------------------------------Screen: The screen size on the 5th gen. is a huge difference from previous generations. A family member still has the 4th, and it amazes me how stocky it looks now. The new length is great, as I do not have to scroll as often, and I can see more of the screen when I am using both hands (and I have small hands). It is definitely more responsive, and no glitches like a previous reviewer stated. The home button is more responsive as well, so I have to learn not to press it so much. The colors are more true to life now, and the screen is not blue or yellow tinted, just normal. The black bars for non-iPod touch 5 (worded as iPhone 5 in the App Store) optimized apps remind me just how small the previous screen was. Most well-known apps are optimized.-----------------------------------Sound: The speaker is slightly louder than the 4th gen. I can officially retire my cereal bowls. However, I have found that having the speaker on the right is a bit of a disadvantage, because I tend to cover it in landscape (right-handed). No biggie. The new EarPods are amazing. They fit much better in my ears, so I can sleep without taking them out. The bass is greatly improved. I never knewRock With You (Single Version)had background bass!-----------------------------------Durability: The anodized aluminum is sturdier than the previous metal back of the 4th gen. The top corner of my iPod just \"slapped\" the side of a tile counter today, and I was very pleased to not find one nick, scratch, or dent. I have yet to see any scratches (I have the White/Silver), and the back is finger-print resistant for the most part. I managed to get some sticky candy cane residue on the screen and sides last week, but I was able to wipe it off with a cloth. Oh, and the loop is sturdy. I have not yet bought a case because of this, as it is super easy to slip on, and it actually helps me steady the iPod in my hand. I'll probably buy some more loops instead of a case. I hated ruining my 4th gen.'s look with a case, even if it was clear. The iPod can hang by the loop and not fall off, which is good in case I lose my grip. The loop is hard to pull off without loosening it (unlike a Wii Remote strap), and has soft fabric where it meets your arm, so I can tighten it without a loss of circulation.-----------------------------------Speed: So, I had to do a few speed tests with a spare 4th generation. The 5th gen. boots in about ten seconds from reset, the 4th gen. takes 20-30 seconds. I opened the App Store in 6 seconds on the 5th gen., while the 4th gen. took 9 seconds. The Camera app launched in 2 and 3 seconds, so hardly any difference there. Overall, the 5th gen. decreases wait time. I don't find myself tapping my fingers like I'm using a Windows PC. It's a click, then a 5 second wait for games, and a 1 second wait for other apps. Safari is also faster, and connects quickly. I find myself with hardly any startup time, which my 4th gen. could take 5-10 seconds. By the way, my iPod touch has YET to crash at all, not even on Safari (which was a leading crasher on my 4th gen.). Graphic-intensive games no longer freeze, and my iPod only warms slightly (the 4th gen. felt like fire).-----------------------------------Camera: This will be short. It's better, period. You get LED flash (Which is an outstanding flashlight with iHandy's app), HDR for enhancement, and less noise. The 4th gen. catches NOTHING at night, while I was able to take a VERY CLEAR semi-family photo with flash in a pitch black room. The video is smoother, and clearer, and the LED flashlight can be used in conjunction with the video camera. Great for nighttime missions.-----------------------------------Battery life: Please do not pay attention to the lemon reviews. I have great battery life. With no WiFi, I was able to get a whopping ten hours of video, photos, games, and etc. Now, my 4th gen. would have died three times over. The calibration of the battery stays accurate. My 4th gen. showed 40-50% after thirty minutes of gaming. The 5th gen. still showed 65-75%. Awesome in my book, as I like to game without being plugged up. These numbers are with Wifi connected. On weekdays, I get a full day (9 a.m.-10 p.m. | Safari, Stock apps, Plaintext) without needing to charge. Weekends are about five hours (Gaming, communication, videos).-----------------------------------Siri and Dictation: Once she learns your voice, Siri can take you far. She didn't really have problems with my accent (I have a moderate Southern accent, and people said Siri couldn't understand them), so the user feedback must be working. She did have problems with drop (thinking it was job), and check (thinking it was Chad), but those are probably the fault of my own tongue. Dictation actually seems to work better than Siri, and it is better than writing long texts (I'm very thorough). I also enjoy the decrease of \"manual labor\". Reminders, FaceTime calls, Messages, Searches, even opening apps are handled through Siri. I never thought the days of a handheld robot would come. ;)-----------------------------------Overall: This was a must-do upgrade for me. I was cross that my 4th gen. was already a year old, and after seeing iOS 6 on it, I knew it would have a slim chance of making it to iOS 7. So, I decided to get onto the 5th's cycle. That was the best choice for me. I was very glad to see so many improvements, and each one is worth it. If you have a lemon, please return and exchange it. Don't give up on this great device.=========================================================================================================Six Month Update (June 24th, 2013):-----------------------------------Speed: My fifth generation is still running as fast as ever, and does not show any signs of slowing down. There is hardly any boot time for apps, and even graphic-heavy apps play smoothly.Screen: The four-inch screen is just so much better for my fingers. I never accidentally press the top of the iPod when I wanted to touch the back button on apps. The screen is nice and bright, and I love the true-to-life colors. I only use a dry fabric (microfiber cloth, shirt, pillow, recliner arm) to wipe the screen. Never use water, or you'll rub off the oleophobic coating and the oils from your skin, which makes the screen easier to swipe and scroll. Also, the screen is very durable, so I can use my nails (they are very firm) to scrap off sticky whatnot, and not worry about leaving a scratch.Siri: After a few months hiatus, I decided to use Siri again. After taking off some contacts' information, I feel safe enough to use the service, and it works splendidly. I'm glad that I don't need to give her my info just to use it, as that's not my preference. I use her to text others when I'm busy and don't want to stop. Timers and reminders are good to use with her, because I have a million of them. Those are such a *pain* to make. . .Sturdiness: Keeping with the s-themed update, I have to talk about this iPod's sturdiness. Just good craftsmanship on Apple's part, seriously. In six months, I only have a side dent and a nick. The back is still nice and smooth, and I would rest it on any surface without a second thought. The loop is history (RIP), and this device is slippery without it. I bought a Belkin case a few months ago, and there has been no more damage to my device, so I'm happy all around."}, {"review_id": "53a232955527c1f8eff01450fd104472", "review": "I didn't customize it very much or mess around with it like I would with most electronics as I had just moved in with a girlfriend and been real busy at the time.

This thing is just so expensive, it's rediculous how highly priced Apple products are. I have preferred Android devices for a long time but had a certain familiarity with an iPod touch I bought at RadioShack in 2007 which I sold to a co-worker in the same year. The features on this are pretty nice, the camera is of very good quality -- even in the dark!I liked how I could use iMessage to text other iPhone users even without an iPhone, however.. the iPhone is basically the same thing but with a phone.. so I don't see what Apple's point was of making a move like this.

Granted, Logitech has a history of making good keyboards that feel and work well even after years of prolonged use. In fact, despite occasional forays into other brands, I've always come back to them. It's gotten to the point where I'd pretty much consider myself brand-loyal.The downside to their products is they're usually more expensive than the competition. There aren't many choices for bluetooth keyboards with memory- the only other one I found was IOGear's Multi-link keyboard. That one looked technically superior in some respects, e.g. it has a trackpad and 6-device memory. It's also about half the price, and I'll admit I was (again) sorely tempted to jump the brand boat and check it out. However, I decided not to due to the fact that I'd probably use a bluetooth mouse anyway, and I don't plan on using this with any more than 3 devices anyhow. Plus, the Logitech K810 has some advantages of its own- namely that it's backlit, rechargeable, and can actually detect when your hands are on it for power management.The keyboard itself is both compact and slim, and is very attractive. It also feels great typing on it despite the fact that it's a compact keyboard. The keys are very quiet in general and the backlighting works well. It lasts a good amount of time on a charge (usually about 2 weeks if you use the backlight), and is rechargeable via micro USB. The keyboard layout is pretty standard, with 3 F keys serving the dual purpose of switching devices and the others to control various functions like backlight intensity and volume control. You switch to the regular F# functionality via a FN key.Switching devices is the big draw of this keyboard, and it works very well- practically instantaneously. The keyboard seems to have memory, so if you type while switching it will backlog the keystrokes. Pairing was also straightforward- there is a standard pairing button on the bottom, and after pushing it you select which device setting to use, then pair as usual. The keyboard also has a manual power switch if you're going to store it. Overall, it works very well in general.The keyboard does lay flat (and only flat) so in that respect it's very similar to Apple's bluetooth keyboards. The feel of this one is different from Apple's but very nice in general- it's comfortable to type on for long periods of time and doesn't take long to get used to. Build quality appears to be very solid- no clattering if you shake it, and although I wouldn't toss it around the room it does look capable of taking a few drops.I've used quite a few bluetooth keyboards over the years, including older Logitechs, cheap ones by Anker, and Apple's. This is definitely my favorite one so far. The switching function and backlighting make it pretty unique, and I would say it's worth the high price."}, {"review_id": "04190ac7dcbb6b509ae61068d2ea806f", "review": "This keyboard is nice and light but doesn't feel flimsy.

Actually, RAW files are not bad at all. They are pretty much equal or very little more noises than 5D MK3. It is just the D600 JPEG engine does not perform as good as 5D MK3. I hope Adobe updates with their RAW support for D600 soon. I have nothing bad to say about the camera now. This is by far the best camera at the price point!(Original Summary)I have been a D7000 user who just got D600. This camera is right at home for me since most controls are similar and better. I am not 100% happy with the AF speed in low light, but hey I did not pay that much, so I should not complain. I love the image quality at lower ISO. However, I envy Canon 5D Mk3's low light performance. D600 at 6400 ISO is usable, but it can get pretty noisy in shadow area. Sony sensors have better DR for sure, but no matter what DxO says, Canon 5D MK3 got better high ISO performance. This issue too I should not complain since I did not pay 5D Mk3 price. As a result, this is still the best camera for me who owns several Nikon lenses. When I first heard that D600 had 12 Mega pixel less than D800, I was hoping D600 would get less noisy than D800. It turned out that they are both similar in low light performance. I guess I was expecting too much from an affordable FF camera.Pros:1. D7000 like controls with improvements2. Amazing image quality at lower ISO3. Affordable Price4. Smaller body5. Faster Continuous Shooting than D8006. Amazing Dynamic Range7. Build-in Flash, HDR, and Timelapse mode8. Supports most Nikon lenses9. Not many people talk about this, but I love the LCD cover on Nikon cameras for protection.10. Battery life is much better than Sony SLT or mirrorless cameras11. Much better Auto ISO setting than D700012. 39 AF points. Yes, the AF area is smaller, but I am OK with it.Cons:1. No aperture control in live view and in movie mode!!! Why?!!! I guess to implement a powered aperture mechanism in a live view costs.2. I thought Sony sensors had better low light performance than Canon sensors in general like in APS-C. D600 still performs much better than D7000 in low light, but I was hoping D600 does little better than what I see from ISO6400 images.3. The AF system suppose to be the same as D7000 or better, but I often get hiccups in low light where D600 sits for a second or so.4. 1/4000 shutter speed, which is slower than D7000. Well, the D600 sensor is bigger, so I guess that is max they can do for the price.5. This is not about the camera, but I was hoping Nikon bundled a better kit lens like Canon 24-105L lens. I guess Nikon 24-120 F4 is too much to bundle as a kit lens then.All in all, I am very satisfied. I know I cannot get everything from a low cost FF camera, but if I can ask for one thing from D600 was to have little better low light performance. Maybe one stop would have made this camera perfect."}], "B009A5204K": [{"review_id": "7438661c3de5a4a68e270647295f1fc3", "review": "One may look at me strangely, friends may call it \"dorky\", others may mistake it for a hearing device, but now it is purely a part of me.

Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal. This is personally a rare problem, but a surprising one when it occurs."}, {"review_id": "aa56490d6cc4620325004e9538543dd4", "review": "I need to do a lot of teleconferencing on the road.

So, I bought this headset because of its good reviews.The sound quality of this headset is wonderful.  I can now hear people's conversation much better than before.  It comes with ear pieces of 3 different sizes.  I really like the ear pieces as they fit into my ears very well and block most of the outside noise.

The earbuds fit well and the sound is very clear.  It also holds a charge through a solid 5 hours a day.  I would charge it at the end of every day, so not sure how much longer it would last if I kept using it.Cons:- Although it is very comfortable and easy to wear during active runs and gym sessions, it just feels flimsy to me.The little earbuds are supposed to be held onto the neckband with little magnets.  These magnets are far too weak and barely hold them in when they are stationary.  They are also not the easiest to fit in place while the neckband is still around your neck.If you do manage to fit them in, the slightest head movement causes them to fall out.This is not only frustrating, but with them just dangling there, they easily got caught on my jacket, shoulder strap of my purse and scarf.It was an accident waiting to happen and I just knew they'd get torn off one day soon.Another concern was how they'd hold up being toted around in bag.  If you don't want to walk around with them hanging around your neck, there's really no easy way to transport them.  I'd wear them on the train to listen to music, but didn't want to leave them on once I got to work.  I'd put them in my bag, but then had to wrestle with a tangle when I retrieved them.Overall very disappointed because although user unfriendly, the sound and comfort of these were great.  If you're just going to be using them at home and not taking them with you, they will suffice.  A bit pricey for being limited like that though.  That's why I ultimately returned them."}, {"review_id": "8750687532bd5dc8f2148d6289ed9e41", "review": "I've had this for a few months now, and it does work.

Either the ear buds were way out of my price range or they seemed to be unreliable. Everyone raved about the original Tone Bluetooth headset, but said it sounded tinny. This set caught my eye because a lot of reviewers said they sounded better than the originals. However, there were a lot of complaints about these headphones dropping connection with the device in a front pocket or only a foot or so away. Other people said they had no problems. It was one reviewer who mentioned that it could be an issue with an older protocol on older phones. Because of his review I decided to take a chance and get them, if I didn't like them I could send them back. (I have an LG Nexus 4 phone.)These arrived, a birthday present I picked out, and I synced them to my phone. They synced effortlessly. I simply turned them on and pressed the button on top that flashed blue. Went into my settings and turned on the Bluetooth and had it search for new devices. It found the headphones, I tapped, they paired, done. I turned on some music, sounded great. I would say it has plenty of base and a nice range. I use the poweramp app, so I was able to tune them the way I like my music to sound. Would I say they would compete with 300.00 headphones, no. But they sound really good for the price. I made a couple of phone calls, clarity was great. Everyone I called said it sounded like I was just talking normal on my phone. The only issue I had was a brother who talked to me over a speaker phone, it sounded echoey, but that was on his end. Everyone else sounded great. I fiddled with the settings and volume, everything works great. As to connectivity, on my Nexus 4, I put my phone in my pants pocket and did my normal tasks, sound never lost quality or dropped. Put it in my back pocket, same result. Decided that evening to check how far away I could get before it would dropp. I left my phone on its charger and walked out of my bedroom on one side of the house to my living room on the other side, the sound quality dropped a little when I got to the far end of the living room, as soon as I stopped the sound quality returned to normal and I finished listening to the song. I then walked downstairs to my basement all the way to the other side and the sound quality cut out for a split second and recovered as soon as I stopped walking. I sat at my computer and listened to music for almost an hour with only a few momentarily noticeable drops in quality and or sound. I figured that was a good enough test for me. I would say that the connectivity equals that of the older model as described in many reviews. So why do some of us rave about these headphones and others curse them? I can only assume that the reviewer who mentioned needing a newer phone with an upgraded protocol was right. With my Nexus phone, they are stellar. Only time will if they are durable. My only negative impression is the necleas doo-hickies on my neck. But I knew that going in. Can't fault the product when you are forewarned."}, {"review_id": "866d2d1161b45303be4df46d9b69f199", "review": "I ordered these headsets to go with my phone (Samsung S4).

While I've only had the 730 for a couple of days, I've had no problems with either unit.  While the 700 has great sound quality, the 730 does sound a little better if your phone/device supports the Apt-X standard.  I'm using these with a Samsung Galaxy S 3, which does support that standard.I agree that the connectivity is slightly worse with the new model, but it hasn't been a problem with my phone on my person.  I also get an occasional \"glitch\" in the music, which I didn't experience before.  This may be from the phone processing the higher-bandwidth streaming.I think the new model processes commands faster--it seems to respond slightly faster when I press pause, skip track, etc.  Other things I like that weren't on the 700 are audible battery status and mute control (by pressing volume +/- at the same time).All-in-all, I prefer the 730 over the 700 for its better sound quality.One other note--I did find the sound quality to be better with a popular mp3 player app than with the standard mp3 player that came with the phone/android.Edit 17Sep13: Connectivity is worse than I originally stated.  I definitely get glitches in the music if the phone is on my belt instead of clipped to my chest while hiking."}, {"review_id": "7cbda8ec3093eec6b7d2438d30f36bbf", "review": "My wife wanted a new bluetooth like the one I had.

It did take a little time to get used to - I found I was unconsciously 'hunching forward' a bit when first wearing it, but it is by no means uncomfortable...just different.  The way the cords are attached with a movable loop, and the provided rubber earpiece covers in different sizes should provide sufficient sizing  options for most users.  I'm fairly bull-necked and I don't feel the cords 'pulling' the earbuds from my ears at all, even when turning my head.The battery took a fair amount of time to take an initial full charge, but after that it seems to last quite a while.  Even after playing a game on my Surface for a 3 hr planeflight, it still said &#34;battery high&#34; the next time I turned it on.  There's a small lighted indicator for the battery charging that goes from red to blue when it hits full.Verbal feedback is great.  &#34;Connected....battery high&#34;.  Audio feedback with beeps of ascending or descending scale when changing volume level.  The buttons are findable with your fingers only when wearing to raise/lower volume, and presumably the answer call button although I'm not using as a phone function.Sound is fairly good - I don't really notice much background hiss, and both music and game audio seems full range.  I actually find I have to have these set at near minimum volume to be comfortable with it, even in high ambient noise situations (airplane), so it's got plenty of oomph.If I have any complaints at all, I wish it had a little more visible &#34;left&#34; and &#34;right&#34; indications, vs. the rather tiny molded letters in a box.  I guess in time I'll get used to the fact that I want the volume up/down buttons on the left side.  Then again, the volume plus or minus indicator vs. the track up track down indicators molded into the buttons are also very small, and don't provide any tactile distinction between them, so its not easy to tell whether you've put them on backwards.  That's one reason for a one star deduction.  The other reason for a slight deduction is I do wish the magnets that hold the ear buds in place when not inserted in the ear were a little stronger, like other reviewers have commented.  They do stay in place when the device is just cuffed around your neck, but tend to wander when tossed in a pocket of my computer or camera bag, so I'm always sort of semi-untangling them (and then squinting at them to figure out left vs right) before I can put them on.Sound does get a little choppy when using this on a Surface with a Bluetooth mouse also enabled.  But that may be the Surface's fault in terms of the available stack bandwidth and prioritization.  Not taking a star off for that.Supplied USB cord for charging is fine.  I don't have any complaints about range since I use them while at the laptop (Surface) not wandering around a football field and expecting them to still connect.Overall quite pleased.  Good sound isolation from background, plenty of volume, audio range is acceptable for music (not audiophile quality by any means - what wireless headphones are? - and besides I'm 40+ so my hearing itself is probably damaged at the high end).  Perfect companions for a lightweight laptop or tablet with Bluetooth.  Just need a little more visual indication and/or tactile differentiation between left and right side buttons (simplest idea but not everyone would like it - just make the whole right side of red plastic and the left side of white or black plastic...).  Will I buy again if I lost them: yes."}, {"review_id": "88a7f98bfab6168da0def5b334a17b2a", "review": "07/14/2014 *** Update***I've had this set for over a year now.  What was good is still good, when the connectivity is there.  When riding my motorcycle and the phone is mounted on my handlebars with nothing between me and the phone, connectivity is good and stays there.When I am doing yard work and the phone is on my right hip, connectivity is iffy.  And I get complaints of echoing and such intermittently.  I thought is was my phone because I had the Android 4.3 upgrade which trashed my wi-fi and I thought might have impacted my bluetooth as well but two weeks ago, I finally got a replacement phone.  The new Phone (Galaxy Note 2-Verizon) accepted the 4.3 and 4.4.2 updates with no issue to my wi-fi this time(YEA!) but the bluetooth issues are still there.  My son has the same headset with a galaxy S4 and the same problems.  My wife has the same headset on her Iphone-4 and no issues.  Go figure.So, my recommendation is this:1)  Buy it, try it out heavily and return it if it does not work.2)  If you have problems, Do not wait to return it or maybe get a fix from LG.  I waited too long and the warranty ran out.When it works, the sound is GREAT.  Good bass (well, let's just say my ears like it but I do have a bit of hearing loss so fidelity is no big deal for me).  Good volume.  Works great with my laptop and android tablet.The sad part is a cheap Bluetooth v2.1 works better with my phone than this one.I purchased this headset for one specific reason.  To be able to listen to music and communicate on the phone when riding my motorcycle.  I did not purchase through Amazon but a local big box store who did price match Amazon.I am going to look for a Bluetooth v4.0.  maybe that will work better.  Note, the v2.1 that work better fit me terribly.  I've got a big head and those did not have enough STRETCH to get around the back of my head.Setup Description:I have the LG730 paired with a Galaxy Note II phone (Verizon).  The phone does not have the stock battery, it has a 9300mah extended battery(warranty ZeroLemon Protection Guarantee CompatibleI mention this because it may be part of the problem I do occasionally have with the headset under the CON section.  I use the case provided by ZeroLemon for my phone.I mount my Galaxy Note 2 on my motorcycle (2007 Goldwing) using a RAM Mount for the phone (RAM Universal X Grip Tablet Tabletsand the handlebar (RAM Mounting RAM B 174 LO4U Reservoir Lowrance.  I bought the wrong phone mount initially but just flipped the prongs around to the smaller set on the back and it works great.  No fear of vibration.  I used it on a 1600 mile trip two weeks ago with no problems.I have a 3/4 Vega helmet with a face shield that I usually have lowered.  I also wear a heavy motorcycle jacket (not a leather jacket but a heavy duty nylon jacket with Kevlar protectors and such).  The LG730 sits inside the jacket and I zip the jack all the way up but leave the collar open to be able to get to the answer button.  The ear buds have no issues as long as I have them stretched out all the way.  I only wear one, not two when riding so check your state laws on that ([...]  I can turn my head left or right and not pull the bud out of my right ear.Usage Experience:PRO:Sound Quality:  Excellent compared to the helmet speakers I was using.  Good Bass and volume levels that are adjustable both on the phone and the headset so you can get the mix you want.  I am NOT an audiophile so I'm not concerned about the highest hi's or the lowest lows.  I just want to hear the music and hold a conversation.Microphone:  Very Good.  I made several test calls to multiple people while riding my motorcycle.  Up until about 40 MPH, they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.  Up to about 70MPH, all they heard was a bit of a buzz from my mufflers but could still hear me clearly and I could hear them quite well.Call notification:  Works well.  I can hear the phone ringing in my ear bud, the phone itself and vibration from the HB730.Call Answer:  Works well with bare fingers and light gloves.  Harder to get with thick gloves but doable (Auto answer would be nice).Wearing:  They are very flexible and comfortable to wear.CONS:When not on the motorcycle, I wear my phone on my right hip.  Sometimes the sound quality goes to pot listening to music while walking.  I\"ll get skips in my songs.  This never happens on the same songs with my wired headset.  Turning off and back on the Tone+ usually clears that issue.  it's not an issue with the battery life (Usually high or on medium) and my phone with the 9300mah battery is NEVER low.  :)  (Love that battery....)I've noticed that when I lift up my left arm, i lose significant signal.  I've got a normal arm, no metals or anything in it but the blue tooth connections severely weakens and the sound almost drops out completely.  Drop my left arm back down, I'm good to go. (This may be related to my extended battery which completely covers the back of my Note 2 phone.  I'll find my original battery and see if I can duplicate the problem.No auto-answer.  Would be nice when working out or riding so I don't have to take a hand off of my handle bar.Hard to find the manual on the LG website.  An odd CON but I was just looking for it(to see if it can auto answer) and finding any support document for the LG Tone+ other than the sales page just wasn't there.Summary.Even with the small cons listed, this is a great Bluetooth headset for my purposes.  I also exercise at the gym with them.  I don't run (yet) but do walk on the treadmill and no problems to date with the slipping off.  Running might cause a problem because the are not tight around the back of my neck and may bounce.If it ever breaks, I'll buy it again."}, {"review_id": "31d4abe3716f2089c8eb59b7199cdd22", "review": "I will say I do not use all the features these headphones offer.What I can tell you is that the Sound quality is very good but not as good as my wired Senheisser.I use the in the Office to listen to music, make phone calls, etc&#8230;These are a &#8220;MUST HAVE&#8221; if you ride a motorcycle.

We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth. Total weight with the T-1204X is about 2.5lbSIRUI G-10 29mm Ballhead with Quick Release, 40 lbs Load Capacity- Canon remote switch: to avoid shaking caused by pushing the shutter release button.Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3"}, {"review_id": "6ccd4d0d9873917553c5256eaae00ef1", "review": "I am at a point in life where lugging around many lenses and other gear is just too much.

I was impressed that a touch screen would be fairly affordable (similar non-touch laptops were in the $500-600 range, so this wasn't a big jump).  I was also excited about the hybrid hard drive, so I took the plunge and bought it.First of all, it's a gorgeous computer.  The brushed black back is lovely and the computer is sleek and smooth and beautiful.  I was already in love when I took it out of the box.  It's light--4 lbs--and super easy to fit into a backpack or even a large purse.  I turned it on, set up Windows 8 (which is initially confusing as heck, even for someone who is totally comfortable using computers), and I started playing with the apps so that I could get a sense of how well the touch screen worked.  I had no problem using the gestures, like pinch to zoom, two-finger scrolling, and panning.  It's as sensitive as any tablet I've used.  Wonderful!  I did briefly have trouble with the touchpad, but after installing all the Asus updates and Windows 8 updates, all is well.  You can do all of the same gestures on the touchpad, by the way.  And the touchpad is huge!  I like it, but it's different than what I'm used to.Okay, so on to the other stuff.  Just so you know, I am a PhD student, so I often have multiple programs open: Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Reader, etc.  I don't require the kind of CPU and memory as someone who does more intensive computing or gaming, but I do notice when things begin to lag.  Things I care about: USB 3.0 (there is one), the touch screen, the sound quality, and ability to run 3-6 programs smoothly and quickly.  As I said, the touch screen is great.  The sound quality is also surprisingly good, and it gets significantly louder than my old laptop.  With headphones plugged in, the sound is excellent, even at the lowest volumes (I've been listening at approx. 12% volume).  And the computer has been great with multiple programs.  I have only had it for a few days, but I've been putting it through the ringer.  So far, it's passed with flying colors.  It's gorgeous, it runs smoothly and quickly for my needs, and it seems to be an awesome product.  This computer and I are a match made in heaven."}], "B009H0XQPA": [{"review_id": "e61649d6361c9f22527ad9f1e82a2e3b", "review": "I am very pleased with my new S2740L.

There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.

After standing in a big box store last night looking at the various options I came across this one. The picture on it was not good, but I figured it had to be the store had some funky settings. It was next to another LED Tv that cost around $200 more, but I went with the vizio anyways thinking I could change the settings to make it work.I got it home in the back of my honda ridgeline truck, it fit perfectly in the bed with the tailgate closed, we got it carried upstairs easily with the wifes help and unboxed it. The TV is massive and when you first turn it on it walks you through a setup wizard.Once the TV was up and running the picture was good, but not great. At least not for watching Hockey. I went into the settings and found the TV had many sport modes, but hockey was not one of them! Anyways, after flipping through the various settings I found the \"Vivid\" setting and that made the picture of the hockey games crystal clear, you could see the ice clear as day, including the skate marks across the lines. The player uniforms popped. It was really amazing how clear the picture actually is.I've only had this tv going on 24 hours now but so far I love it. Yes the sound is not phenomenal. It's not bad but I had a sound bar I hooked up to it and use that."}], "B009LL9VDG": [{"review_id": "bb8dd0034fd27e28738d9766ad39c995", "review": "I bought this for my girlfriend who mainly just checks her email, facebook, google, etc.  I was skeptical at first, but after a little use, I now see what the fuss is all about with these chromebooks.

There is a part of me that wishes I shopped around and spent $100 on a Chromebook with a better screen (they would have other drawbacks of course). But I bought the Chromebook mainly for one task  and that was budget google docs which the Chromebook does well.I bought a chromebook because I did not want to spend $1000 on a new laptop and everything below that price always seemed like a rip off. They would have nice specs, but crappy screens, etc. I bought the chromebook because just about everything I do is in chrome and I have a desktop at both home and work if I need to do heavy typing.I do plan to use this to take heavy duty notes when I observe teachers (I am a high school admin.) but have not done so yet and will update this review when I do.ProsScreen has good viewing angles, much better than I expectedVery lightMassive battery lifeTurns on fastI have not found a website that the chrome book has had anymore issues loading the chrome does on a computer.Offline mode works great for google docsFriend of mine logged onto their office 365 account so that works too.ConsScreen is not the best, but no worse than any screen on a $400-500 laptopGoogle maps is a little slow to load, I hear this may have to do with a few new things it no longer does in the backgroundGoogle docs is great for typing documents, but if you need excel forget it.Overall this laptop feels like one worth twice as much.

I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of \"apps\" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified \"favorites\" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think \"dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today\") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done. The times are a-changin', and as the cloud expands in the size and diversity of products they offer, this will become even more useful over time."}, {"review_id": "6dec039d18d4a1d0bcd6cf2c987a2523", "review": "I really love my macbook air, and I seriously considered buying another one for my kids to use. Then this little guy showed up. I was sold when Engadget said it was 80% of the macbook air experience at a fraction of the price. I'd say it's more like 60% of the macbook air experience, but that's still an incredible deal for the price.Drawbacks:You can't print. You can set up google cloudprint but I haven't gotten it to work yet. You can't do anything that isn't inside a web browser. 95% of my computer usage is inside google chrome anyway, so that's not a huge deal for me as a second computer. You can't edit video or do anthing else that requires more than a simple file system and a web browser.Advantages:The keyboard and touchpad are near-mackbook quality. That makes them better than 70 percent of all laptops out there. Not a small thing. I love the two-finger scrolling which you can reverse so it works like a mac. Google calls it simple scrolling. There is two-finger right click too.The screen is fine. I wish I could put the bottom-of-the-screen launcher bar on the side of the screen to save precious vertical pixels.Interface is good. I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality."}, {"review_id": "2b730660a0ab41182f6b5dc3b83daa97", "review": "It's much too difficult to navigate and download files.

Keep in mind, I came straight over from primarily using HDDs for my mass storage devices, thus the difference to me was more noticeable than for someone moving between SSDs (depending on their quality, of course.) For those who are more technically inclined or interested, I will paste benchmark data for the drive's performance at the end of the review.The design of the drive is very sleek and stylish. It boasts a smooth, polished, black exterior to house the powerful internals. You see what you expect out of an SSD: a lot of performance using a very small amount of space. I was a little bummed when I had to install it out of view as it was quite pleasant to look at.Installation is simple just like any other SATA drive; plug it into your motherboard and power supply, and you'll be smooth sailing from there.I'll discuss performance in terms of what's visibly noticeable, and following the conclusion, as aforementioned I will post benchmark results. From the moment I power on, to when I reach the login screen is only a span of about ten seconds or so (possibly slightly less); this is honestly a very quick process. If I didn't have a password lock, I would obviously boot into my system much quicker without having to input the keystrokes for the password. After I log in, I am instantly able to begin opening programs, and they load quickly. Anything from Firefox or Chrome, my large Steam library, or large movie files. I have not attempted to utilize any hungry video/photo editing programs, but you can rest assured that your loading times with those would be low as well. Furthermore, I play very high performing games such as Skyrim with high-res texture mods, Battlefield 3, and Anno 2070 to name a few.When considering this SSD for purchase, keep in mind the cost per GB when thinking about what size of SSD to get. Of course, if you just want to boot your OS quickly and some important high performance programs, you are likely better off with a smaller SSD with a larger HDD to store other files. In my case, I've installed the OS, all of my programs, and games to the SSD, while having a couple of other much larger HDDs to store the large movie files, music libraries, etc. Keep in mind, I don't install all of my games simultaneously to allow more room for other purposes. I purchased this SSD during a sale, thus granting me a better value per GB of space on this 256gb drive. If budgeting is important, considering waiting for a big sale as an option. Should money not be a concern, Samsung will be releasing high performance 1TB SSDs to the market for a much higher price point, but you will be able to get HDD storage sizes with the incredible speeds of an SSD.In summary, purchasing this SSD will not disappoint you or your wallet. You get a nicely designed product with stellar performance at a great price point, especially during a good sale. If you're coming from primarily using HDDs, you will be blown away by the colossal difference in speeds. In most cases, price will be the major deciding factor between what size of SSD to purchase. With this particular drive size, it would behoove you to consider using it in tandem with a HDD of a much larger storage capacity.Pros:-Amazing, noticeable performance, especially if coming from HDD usage-Stylish design-Great value per GB, especially if purchased during a saleCons:None encounteredBechmark:As promised, here are the results I obtained from running CrystalDiskMark:Sequential Read :  503.236 MB/sSequential Write :  478.656 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  447.499 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  154.937 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  31.125 MB/s [  7598.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  99.221 MB/s [ 24223.9 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  337.172 MB/s [ 82317.5 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  141.240 MB/s [ 34482.4 IOPS]Finally, as a reference point, these are the specs of the system I use this SSD with:Gigabyte Z87X-UD4H moboIntel i7 4770k 3.5GhzCoolermaster Hyper 212 EvoGigabyte GeForce GTX 770 4GBCorsair Vengeance 2x4GB (8gb) 1600mhz 9-9-9-24Samsung 840 PRO 256gb SSD(primary)Seagate barracuda 500gb 5400rpm HDD (data storage)Western Digital 1gb HDD (data storage)Samsung 24x DVD driveCorsair HX750Coolermaster Storm Trooper"}], "B009NHAEXE": [{"review_id": "ef74e6df3e3c3384764f1b54170ff79c", "review": "If you have an old PC - this and a good amount of memory are your best performance upgrade bets."}, {"review_id": "3b05f96811dbd5121fce255f3f50fcd3", "review": "Got this SSD at a great price for my ASUS laptop.

I confirmed this as I did some videoing during the blizzard.  I bought the Wasabi battery pack with charger and their 1200mAh batteries do out last the stock batteries of 1050mAh.  But it won't  add significant life and you cannot swap the battery out with the GoPro Battery BacPac.  So I recommend buying more batteries and having at least 1 battery BacPac.END OF UPDATEThis is a review of the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  I am not going to explain what 1080i/30fps mean or any other specifics.  You should already know that since you are looking at this camera.  This is not the forum for technical explanations of what 4.7 Cin means for example.With that said, when I received the Hero3 the first thing I did was fully charge it.  I then went to preform a firmware update.  This was not needed as my camera came up-to-date.  I am running Windows 7.  I have shot pictures and video with it and it lives up to its expectation.Battery Life:  The battery life is short.  More so with the wifi on and/or LCD attached.  (I also bought the battery bacpac and the LCD Touch Screen).  I believe the problem of battery life to be the battery itself.  I own a Hero2 also.  The Hero2 uses an 1100mAh.  The Hero3 uses a 1050mAh.  It doesn't seem like much but I think the -50mAh is what hurts the Hero3.  I also ordered extra batteries from Wasabi.  I believe that these batteries will help this issue as they are 1200mAh.  These have not arrived.  When they do I will post some test results.  I plan on testing all the batteries alone and in conjunction with the battery bacpac.Freezing up:  I have had both my Hero2 (with the new update) and Hero3 freeze on me.  This only happened 1x each and it was when I was trying to rush through the menus. Since then, I have not had any freezing up issues.The screen:  I see people complaining about the little black and grey screen.  It's fine.  You are not buying this camera for fancy screen.  If you want a fancy screen; buy something different or get the touch screen.  The touch screen does improve moving through the menus immensely.  This camera is small so that it can be used in extreme situations without being cumbersome. It's smaller size and weight reductions is incredible.  I hardly notice it when using the head strap.Why I gave this a 4 star rating .... The camera functions as it was promised.  I am a little disappointed that they went to a lesser battery.  Meaning from a 1100mAh to a 1050mAh.  I am also upset with the fact that for all products I have to print out the manuals.  when spending $400 ... I expect the manuals.  Lastly, no covers.  If you want covers for the camera itself and the housing, you have to purchase them separately.  with those few list inconveniences; it was enough for me to take away 1 star.Few last words: DO NOT BY THIS CAMERA FROM GOPRO ... Their customer service SUCKS!!!  Good luck getting anything from them aside of long waits on the phone.  I purchased mine thought Amazon.I hope this helped."}, {"review_id": "d08024b4edbd48cdc2875a2497cac331", "review": "We have been using the Hero 2 for a couple of years and have loved it.  We use our Hero for taking video of skiing, rafting, body boarding, and getting underwater images.  So we were excited to give the Hero 3 a try.  The Hero 2 is a great camera, and the Hero 3 follows in that tradition, but the redesign has resulted in a few problem areas.  Below are the pros and cons after nearly four weeks of use:Pros-  It is perhaps 30% thinner than the Hero 2.  The slim form factor is immediately noticeable and welcome.  I always felt the 2 was too bulky.- Using the menu system is about the same.  That is, you use a pair of buttons to navigate through a series of two-level menus.  Your options show up on the small LCD screen on the front of the Hero.  The great thing about the Hero 3 Black Edition is that you can control the menus via a mobile iOS app over WiFi.  The app greatly enhances the the ease of use of the Hero 3.  If you don't  use the app (or the add-on LCD screen), be sure you practice navigating the menus and understanding the camera's features before you use it.  The menu and features are moderately intuitive but we need to refer to the user's manual for one-off features.- The WiFi on the Black version is great.  As mentioned before, the iOS app let's you change the camera's settings, but it also allows you to preview what the camera sees without having to buy the $70 LCD add-on.  Using the WiFi feature was very easy and makes this camera worth the price.  You can remotely start recording set the recording features (resolution, time lapse, etc.)  The Black edition also comes with a rechargeable wireless remote that replicates the small monochrome LCD screen on the Hero 3. You can navigate the two-level menu on your remote like you would on the Hero 3 itself.- The quality of the captured video is amazing.  You can select resolutions from VGA through 4k cinema quality.  We use ours at HD resolution and get great results.  The lens is wide angle, so you capture all of the action.- The camera is very versatile.  One of our favorite features is the looping feature that allows the camera to loop back over itself.- You can save your video in RAW camera format to do significant post-processing.  This is a great feature for pros.  It also has a \"Protune\" feature that records at 24 fpm (a TV standard).- You can take photos while it records video.  This feature works great, giving us clear wide-angle shots.- The LCD and extra battery pack that we used with our Hero 2 also work with the Hero 3CONS- The camera is fast and responsive, but a couple of times the camera has frozen while I'm paging through menus.  I have the latest firmware update, so maybe another one is needed by GoPro.  We have to shutdown the camera to unfreeze it.- The sound is decent, but not super-clear.  GoPro makes it clear that using the waterproof case will muffle the sound.  Well, that's the price you pay for a waterproof case.  With the standard case, the sound is better.  Without a case, the sound is very acceptable (but it still doesn't match the quality of the video).  We have not tried out the external mic, but it wold be a good idea to use it if great sound is important to you.- The battery life is only about two hours in our best case.  A second battery would a good idea.CONCLUSIONA great camera.  It is the first generation of an overhaul, so you might well-served waiting for the Hero 4, but the Hero 3 really is a good choice if you want to get your adventures on film.  We love using it for filming wildlife (using the MiFi iOS app), on rollercoasters, etc.  THe positives definitely outweigh the negatives.

Although I think their is no difference between the two USB ports. The Astro3E claims it can charge most smartphones 6 times before it dies out. When it does die out you can conveniently charge it with the included usb cable that has an interchangeable plug. This interchangeable plug can be swapped out with 3 other plugs that come with it. The device itself tells you how much power it has by the four led lights on the front of the battery. The less lights the less battery power. According to the manuel of the battery it takes about 8 hours to fully charge this battery. That is not that bad for what it outputs!Although you may have never heard of the Anker brand I highly recommend it. Their customer service is great and they make great and affordable products.

I've been using it constantly for about 3 weeks now. It takes a while to charge (several hours, even when it is 75% full already) but it seems to last forever. I went to a concert with it this past weekend and it charged my phone fully before the concert, then again near the end of the concert (I was taking pictures on my phone and uploading them) while simultaneously charging a friend's phone.

So I highly recommend this battery to everyone!"}], "B009X3UW2G": [{"review_id": "8f2340d07837ebb098f537de8142a67f", "review": "Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google \"Meenova.com\" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google \"Install Flash On Nexus 7\"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10\" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like \"do I need an umbrella today?\" Ask \"Weather forecast (your location).\"Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri \"what are you wearing\" gets her to say \"Why do people keep asking me that?\" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the \"NAvFree USA\" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying \"in 100 meters, turn right.\" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan."}], "B009XNBFJK": [{"review_id": "8e7fb2340c995af7c2d099584b2feb0b", "review": "** READ this before you dive in!

The kind you don't have to quibble about. It's there in abundance for any conceivable need you might have. That aside, I see this M100 as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the M100 using bass reduction, since I listen to music in quiet places mainly, and my tastes are mostly midrange-centric.The M100's sound is slightly dark, having 1-2 db less output in the presence area around 3-5 khz and more output in the upper bass than many other full-size headphones (ex: Beyer COP, B&O; H6, Senn MOE). Some of the other dark-sounding headphones I have don't compete with the M100, because they don't have the clarity and accuracy of musical tone that comes with the higher quality drivers and manufacturing standards that the M100 benefits from. Despite the impression of 'dark', the overall sound is quite lush, and very smooth from top to bottom. Although I stated above that all of the comments from here down apply to using bass reduction with the M100, I must repeat here that with bass reduction on, the bass is as strong as any good hi-fi headphone that has good bass. Some of the so-called 'neutral' headphones will have bass that's significantly weaker than the M100 even when the M100 bass is reduced, so I think the concept of hi-fi neutral is overdue for a revision.Some reviews I've read describe the M100's midrange as recessed, but of course that's with the default bass as I noted above. How you perceive the midrange depends a lot on where you play the M100. Outdoors, on public transport, in a noisy club - those environments tend to absorb most of the bass, so the M100 should be ideal in those cases when played flat (no EQ). Listening at home late at night when it's very quiet is where you'll hear the most detail, since the background noise level can be 30 or more db lower than outdoors in the daytime, and even a lot lower than the indoor daytime noise level. In summary, excellent sound for high fidelity music playback, if you follow my reasoning. Soundstage is mostly dependent on the music of course, but frequency balance plays a large role as well - since most reviewers are adamant about not using EQ, when they evaluate the M100 in their very quiet listening locations, the strong bass makes the midrange seem more distant, hence the soundstage follows from there.Isolation seems quite good, but most isolation is at the higher frequencies, so loud noises from air conditioners or dishwashers etc. may intrude if your music is soft and quiet. Leakage is low, but if you're in a very quiet office in a cubicle right next to other cubicles and you play your music loud, someone in the next cube may hear your music faintly, and some people are bothered by the least bit of leakage that way. It's very doubtful that leakage from the M100 would be noticeable to anyone on a noisy bus, train, or plane.My first M100 was pearl white, and this one is matte black. The sound seems about the same a year after the first one I had, and the fit is very similar also. But just in case I had the impression of a tight fit with my first M100, this current M100 is ultra-comfortable - so much so that I'm wearing it for hours at a time with no adjustments. The sound is so good (as described above) that I'm enjoying classical, jazz, electronic, rock, and other genres of music like never before - everything from Daft Punk, David Chesky, and David Lynch sounds just as spectacular as Michael Buble, Korn, and Miles Davis.The M100 in matte black (my color choice) is beautiful, and its military-gear stealth look is not only very classy, it doesn't tend to show dirt and grime. The military-grade look isn't just superficial though - the build quality is the best in the headphone business - all metal and perfectly finished, but not heavy on the head. At the time I purchased the M100, an extra set of metal earcup side plates was offered, with choice of color and even a custom logo. Those custom plates aren't expensive and they can be attached or detached at any time, so if the headphone is transferred to another person that person can use the standard side plates instead. Headband clamping force with the M100 is very moderate for a full-size headphone, and if the headband were ever to become uncomfortable on top of a user's head, I suggest pulling the earcups down an extra click so most of the weight is borne by the earcups.The earpads go completely around my ears, unlike some headphones that are described as circumaural (around the ear). The Sennheiser Momentum is one such headphone where the earpads sit partially on my average-size ears. The earpads are very soft and spongy, covered in 'pleather' I would guess, and are the most comfortable type of earpad I've used. The M100 has a single-sided detachable cable that can be plugged into either the left or right earcup. The fabric-covered cable is terminated with a 45-degree angled Apple miniplug, and the end that goes into the earcup is a standard (non-Apple) miniplug. In case of cable failure, any generic miniplug to miniplug cable could be used, as long as the sleeve ahead of the plug that goes into the earcup is no bigger than 7mm in diameter.The 4-foot cable has a one-button control with mic about 13 inches down from the earcup, and an additional mic about 4 inches down from the earcup. A second (7-foot) cable is included, having the same plugs as the 4-foot cable, but no controls or microphone. The 7-foot cable also has a short (3.5 inches) extension on the end in a 'Y' configuration, where you can plug a second headphone in. I didn't try it, but I wonder what the effect on the sound would be if you plugged two 18-ohm headphones into a music player using this cable. It seems like that would create a 9-ohm load for the music player, or even less if the minimum impedance of the headphones were less than 18 ohms. The M100 comes with a small zippered carrycase that's suitable for backpacks and airline carry-on bags.In previous reviews I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to those other reviews and see how the M100 compares with each individual track. Note that the comments below apply to the M100's sound played with Bass Reducer EQ as noted above.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals sound natural, without favoring either. The M100 plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off sounds realistic, and the sax is soft. The M100 plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice is crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The M100 reproduces the space and detail convincingly, although if this is played very loudly the percussion may be too bright.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments. The voice and high-frequency percussion (tambourine especially) sounds natural with no harshness. The M100 plays this music perfectly.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the ambient electronic effects maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or \"ringy\" sound as some headphones do if they have uncorrected resonances. The M100 plays this track just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The M100 handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced. The M100 makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the M100 handles this perfectly. The trumpet sounds natural but soft, and the voice has the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The M100 does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the M100 handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep \"shuddery\" kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the M100 delivers on those.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the M100 gets it right. The percussion and female voice balance well with neither overwriting the other. The M100 aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the M100. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The M100 balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices have a good balance and don't overpower the music or sound recessed. The M100 plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The M100 plays this very well given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The M100 renders the percussion treble correctly (bright, but not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The M100 renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some \"clip-clop\" effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The M100 reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality. The M100 plays this track very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the M100 renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The M100 delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the M100. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the M100 headphone."}], "B00A3YN0Z0": [{"review_id": "ee41e677b4be9f9b11aff20115ad06f7", "review": "To be fair, this product has good and bad qualities...ADVANTAGES.1.

An informed consumer decision to buy or not to buy is determined by previous user experiences with these qualities via the product reviews. When a company threatens \"to stack the market in its favor\" by misusing the legal system to suppress a critique of its wares, the firm violates the true essence of a competitive economic system - let the market decide. In other words, allow the buyers the freedom to read the reviews - good and bad - to help them make their decisions to buy..On this matter, Mediabridge should have ignored the ranting of one person. Before the incident, it's router was the best seller and had the highest ratings. After the incident, everything has changed. Negative publicity has reversed these accolades. . . . Unfortunately, \"spilled milk\" could not be placed back into the bottle..For me, the market did decide in the end. I did not purchase a third Medialink router. The Asus RT-N66U was the replacement. It was highly rated by professional evaluations as well consumers."}], "B00AAIPT76": [{"review_id": "d2fd84659363c486b2be311ffb437bbc", "review": "I bought this after the first spare gopro battery I bought wouldn't hold a charge.

For the HS50EXR, the phrase &#34;DSLR-like&#34; sums it up almost entirely.There are many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere that touch on the HS50's main features, so I won't go into those beyond saying that the manual zoom is great and the image quality (which has been spoken poorly about in some cases) is actually quite good.  This review is intended to hit on features that might not get immediate consideration when you're looking for a bridge camera.I purchased the HS50EXR as a backup to my DSLR, something that would be easy to carry and that my wife (who is not a photographer) could use and get good results.  Also, I needed something with strong video capabilities that would auto-focus well.  This camera delivers in spades.  It's fantastic, full-featured, and easy for my wife to use but with enough control to give experienced photographers plenty to play with.A few points that don't get much press about this camera:Focus Ring: This camera features manual focus via a free-spinning focus ring behind the zoom ring.  The focus control is strictly electronic, but the focus ring has a quick, responsive, and organic feel to it.  Obviously, for video work you'd want to be able to exert a bit more control over focus, but overall it's impressive.  In photo mode, there are focus highlights that appear on whatever the lens is focused on, a useful feature that the Magic Lantern crowd will recognize and appreciate.  Sadly, that same crowd will be sorely disappointed to find out this feature is not present in video mode.  Video mode will allow manual focus, of course, but without the handy focus peak highlights.Bayonet/58mm Lens: This camera includes a bayonet-style tulip lens hood (which was impressive to me), and also accepts 58mm lens accessories.  That was my big gripe about other bridge cameras; there was no way to provide the glass with any protection.  The HS50EXR lets you put a UV filter on the front, which is especially crucial considering you don't have the luxury of replacing a lens if it gets dinged up.Video Quality:  One of the best things about this camera is its video quality.  It is sharp, responsive, quick to focus, maintains focus easily, and there are a number of high-fps options for slow-motion video.  Of course, the faster the shutter goes, the lower your resolution gets, but if you're looking to capture something cool at a high frame rate, this will definitely do it.  One disappointment for video mode is that you are not allocated any control over exposure, so no aperture, shutter speed, etc that you would get on a DSLR.Articulated Screen:  This is great for videographers like myself who need to frame a shot while being in front of the lens.  Very handy.Q Button:  This is a great feature for the camera to have.  In true DSLR fashion, you have a dedicated screen to adjust ISO, white balance, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  Fantastic, easy to use, and handy.Now, there are a few things that I would have changed on this camera that keep it from getting a full 5 stars:Plastic Tripod Socket:  This camera is big and heavy, like a small DSLR.  The tripod socket is a heavy-duty hard plastic, but I would have much rather had something metal.Lack of Control in Video Mode:  I like that you can use manual focus in video mode, but other than that you get what the camera gives you, which is not exactly what I want.  Still, the video mode is great on its own.Sensor Size:  This is the biggest difference between the HS50EXR and a true DSLR.  Even an entry level DSLR will dwarf the 1/2&#34; sensor that this camera sports.  The HS50EXR's sensor is the most tangible throwback to its point-and-shoot roots, but don't write it off immediately.  While you'll never fool anyone into thinking your shots came from a DSLR, you'll be sure to get some excellent looking shots.  Even some camcorders at this price level have smaller sensors than this, so it's not as bad as people say it is.  In fact, I think considering its size, the images look amazing, but I would have liked to see Fuji use a bigger sensor to live up to the DSLR features and aesthetics.If you're looking for a good family camera that's a jack-of-all-trades that yields great results, this is what you're after.  If you're on the fence about this camera and a full-fledged DSLR, go with the DSLR.  I was glad I purchased a DSLR before purchasing this camera because it gave me a much better sense about what the HS50EXR can and can't do.  Once you understand its limitations and capabilities, you can really start making great images with this camera.  I definitely recommend it."}], "B00ATM1MVA": [{"review_id": "75342a8e53d409ea0e6664fcb1cb344c", "review": "First, the image quality of this camera is very impressive. Extremely sharp and with the f2.0 lens, you can get wonderful bokeh effects. What I do NOT like is the slow autofocus, which seems to occur in both dim and bright environments. I am not expecting dSLR speed, but the ability to focus rapidly and capture images of people. Like many guys, I bought this after selling my dSLR gear that was simply too big and heavy to use consistently. I keep this camera out on the table so if my family does something funny or cute, I can take a picture right away. The slow focus, however, is very noticeable and I am beginning to not trust the camera to do what I want it to do.An upcoming vacation will be the real test, including taking some family portraits for friends. If it fails or gives me softly-focused shots at that time, I will be very disappointed and will likely start looking fondly back at my Nikon, which was always lightning-fast and focused spot-on."}], "B00AWKC0JM": [{"review_id": "53d9b5dbd12b43453b10f63f6e9f5778", "review": "Reasons for rating: It's a SONY.

I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a tad big for my hands, which might just be a little smaller than average - but it always seemed to me it is harder for those with larger hands to find mice, so that's probably a good feature. It is still a big improvement! It has nice grip on the thumb side and a nice-feeling semi-rubberized right side (which I wish were a little more grippy). The scroll wheel has a very nice feel and grip. The nano receiver fits into the bottom fairly firmly. Completely plug and play on my MacOS10.8 setup. Tracks and slides nicely, feels quality all over. The DPI changing button is in a nice spot where you won't accidentally hit it, too. Great buy!"}, {"review_id": "17c58718717fbfc1161dba3b96fb3178", "review": "First, the price is nice, if it were $10-15 more I would rank it a 3, as in, \"it's okay\" or better but a bit too pricey for what it is. However, at this price, \"I like it\" a lot. If it is durable it may earn my \"I love it\" -- especially since I will probably use it pretty hard (8-12 hours a day, in and out of a laptop bag nearly every work day), and since it is a $15 mouse I won't be all that careful about it.It is my main mouse for a desktop replacement laptop, both travel with me to work most days. So, I will see how it holds up and update if it wares out or develops problems - if I don't update that means that it is still going strong and I still stand by this review. If it lasts into the 5 year range I will update and probably change it to 5 stars.Next the review points:Pros:To start, I like this mouse. It feels good in my medium-large man hands. The grip on the thumb side feels good; although, I had to push mine into place as it was peeling on arrival and it continues to be somewhat loose or prone to getting pulled out of place, it sits to high above the surrounding plastic [Edit, this continues to be \"loose\"]. (I do wish there was a thin strip on the pinky side.)The adjustable DPI will probably be nice for some light game play and some situations, but I generally just keep it on the lowest setting. But having the option is a bonus.The mouse is nice and responsive and I have not noticed any lags (I'm using it on an Ivy Bridge I5 3230m in a Toshiba Satellite L series, Windoze 8 and will be dual booting Kubuntu, when I get a chance to set it up; if I don't update the mouse works fine as a native in Ubuntu as I expect it will [edit, confirmed, works in every distro I've played around with lately (all Debian/Ubuntu forks)]).The back and forward rocker works great and is also very nice to have.The mouse moves smoothly and works on every reasonable surface I've tried it on, including the number pad on the side of my laptop keyboard, which is nice.Range is good, as advertised about 15 feet through walls, etc and about 25 feet in the perfect situation (in the same room or outside).Cons:I wish it had a real off switch since it wakes the Laptop up on button click, until the mouse shuts itself off; you have to take the dongle out when you are transporting the laptop or shut off the wake up settings.This boarders on nitpicking and is related to the previous point: I wish it had a clip like some Logitech mice do so that it clips to the back of my screen and when clipped it shuts off the mouse so that it doesn't wake up the pc -- [edit, I really, really wish that it had such a clip]. This is a good thing because it protects the mouse by ensuing that it is in the padded case with the laptop, rather than just thrown into the bag or outside pocket to get banged, bumped, and (maybe) broken. I really don't understand why anyone would manufacture a wireless mouse without this feature. It just makes good business sense and is relatively cheap.Finally, the mouse does feel a bit less high end. As I mentioned the grip pad for the thumb was out when I took it out of the box, but other things don't quite fit right. One corner of the battery cover sticks out and is a bit stiff to remove (feels like you might break it), but hopefully I'll only replace the battery ever year or so.Overall the mouse feels just solidish. As in, somehow I suspect it isn't as durable is my partners beat up 3-4 year old Logitech that is still going strong. But only time will tell and that Logitech was almost twice the price.Nit-picking (in order of importance):The scrolling wheel is a little high and I wish it was closer to the tip of my middle finger.This boarders on obnoxious nitpicking, but the material you touch is that slick glossy plastic and I wish it had a bit of texture.The slick material feels, sweaty or something, I don't know, I don't like touching it as much as other mouse textures -- yeah, it is nitpicky, I know.At this point I strongly recommend this product. I like it a lot right now for its price, but if it proves durable that may make me love it (as in 5 stars).If you are a cheap-skate like me and looking for a good mouse, I think this is it. If you are a high-end type, this isn't it.I will update when the battery dies, currently it has one AA Eneloop that was fully charged when installed.[Edit, a month after purchase, I like it okay, but I think the 4 stars will stick and I very much wish that I'd gotten one with a off switch and/or a clip -  I would've payed $10-15 more for these things.]"}], "B00BCGRTFK": [{"review_id": "30816798e5d54966ae02ad7a79e138e4", "review": "The TV is great, till you compare the color depth and contrast dark areas to my older flat screen.

I searched for help, there is none for the problem both of these units have. I wrote to Roku's customer service and got no response at all. It appears to have a significant design flaw; I suspect it is in the unit's software.You may be thinking I just don't know how to use it and don't follow directions, but that would be wrong. I am a very senior engineer and I design chips similar to the one used in the Roku, and I use similar technology all the time. I am a professional at debugging electronics and did all the sensible tests. Other source devices work perfectly with the exact same cables & TV. I could bring it into the lab but it's not worth my time. I updated the software in the first one, it did not make any difference. It is clear these Roku 3 units have a serious problem. And Roku could not be bothered responding to this customer's written request.Symptoms? Upon power-on, the Roku's display on the TV has very bad flickering, with blinking horizontal bands all over the display. It is completely consistent. It does not happen with any other source devices.So, if you get one and it works, you're lucky, but if it doesn't you are out of luck and you might as well return it right away.This is most unfortunate, and a significant waste of time.

She said it was great and could be transferred from TV to TV in the house. (must stay within com distance of your Wi-Fi device).The Roku 3, which is the model I purchased, requires HMDI cable to the TV and Wi-Fi connection OR Ethernet (Cat 5) cable to the Internet.Once connected there were just a few very easy on-screen prompts to connect and sign-on to the Roku.ONE VERY IMPORTANT CONNECTION STEP: In my research of the Roku I kept seeing the same step emphasized to connect the Roku.  You're TV should have several &#34;source&#34; connections (where the source program inters the TV).  The remote control should have a &#34;source&#34; selector.  If you don't go to the correct &#34;source&#34; input you will not see the Roku input.  READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT COME WITH THE ROKU.  The included instructions for mine were very easy to understand.Most programming received through the Roku is subscription based, or &#34;Pay Per View&#34;, with a couple of exceptions, like UTube.  I am a NetFlix subscriber so I just added &#34;ON-DEMAND&#34; services for a few extra dollars a month.Roku 3 has a very small remote control.  It's very easy, comes with ear buds to plug into the remote for private listening, and the remote works on Radio Frequencies instead of Infra-Red to communicate with the Roku.  This means that the remote does NOT have to have an unobstructed line-of-sight to the Roku.It sounds like, from what I've read, some of the earlier models are very good also.  So, if you are counting penny's you might consider them.  Some have different connection requirements/abilities.BOTTOM LINE: I would recommend this device to my friends."}, {"review_id": "998248a2572c098fc43af61c4b89e75d", "review": "We were using a game console to watch our streaming services through.

I am old fashioned enough to want to watch tv on a television (not on my laptop) but new age enough to have already converted my phone, bill pay, shopping, and everything else online.  On top of that, it did not make sense to me to pay over $60/mo more for cable tv when I do not watch tv for weeks at a time and have a limited selection of shows that I like when I do.  The Roku helped me to understand that I did not have to pay a monthly rental fee for a tv box in order to get HDTV.  My tv resolution is great. Set up is simple.  Plus, it is like getting tv on demand for a numerous selection of my all time favorite shows.  I watch what I like when I want- even if it's 2 am.  I do miss the court tv shows, like Judge Judy, and I would rather watch the regular news broadcast rather than 2 minute snippets.  But, I love being able to pick and choose what I want to pay for. I subscribe to Hulu for $8 per month and Netflix for $8 per month. This combined with Amazon Prime gives me a large selection to shows and movies. I can even take the box with me and watch a movie with a friend - by simply taking the box with me when I visit.  Watch a movie with someone else and you have paid for the cost of Netflix. I love the overwhelming selection plus the search options. I also like that I can use my iPad as a remote control for my tv or to browse on Roku while watching tv.  The very best part is that my cable bill is lower and my selection is better.  More for less?

I was able to find a factory refurb with a full warranty + included cables for about 15 bucks cheaper than the Roku 3 alone on Amazon. I'm using the money I saved to purchase an extended warranty. I love Amazon, but I recommend shopping around. I would have settled on the Roku 2 had I not found that deal! So, I basically paid a little over the price of a Roku 2 for a Roku 3 with cables, and once I buy the extended 2 year warranty, I'll have paid slightly more than a brand new Roku 3 with a weak 90 day warranty.Netflix became my main source of entertainment after I cut down on the amount of TV channels I have. Unfortunately, I rarely got to use Netflix after my good computer crashed. Since then, I've been operating an old nearly outdated laptop, and it works for most of my daily needs (social media, mostly) so I haven't felt the need to upgrade and replace it yet. However, it's had issues loading Netflix from time to time, so I began looking into streaming media players. That, plus the fact I have a nice flat screen I was gifted a couple Christmases back that's been going to waste. Why have a nice TV if all you can use it for is basic cable?Enter the Roku, the ideal option for someone who cares more about having content to watch (or listen to) than playing games or anything else. We have an Xbox in the living room which is fine and dandy, but I barely use it myself and it wasn't worth it to me to buy a gaming system for movies/TV alone when I could just buy a media player. Plus, the Roku does have some more simple games, like Angry Birds, which is really cool.Set up is simple, it boots up quickly and navigation is easy. If you have Netflix and Hulu you'll have more shows and movies than you could ever watch for under 20 bucks a month. I've been running the Hulu trial and will definitely be purchasing it when it runs out.I did have one issue where it locked up and reset itself already on day 1. I was worried that this was an issue because it was a refurb, but I did some investigative work and found out that it's a fairly common issue with Rokus and it's related to software, not hardware.I'm not too fussed about it, everything else is going fine, and if it becomes a recurring problem, well, that's what warranties are for.If you've got the extra money, the Roku 3 is great, though I was going to go with the 1 or 2 until I found a deal on the 3. I hear it has a better interface than the other models but I can't confirm, and there's also Youtube access, but that's said to be coming on the other models in the near future, so really, any Roku will serve the average consumer well! Just know that the 3 only has HDMI output option, so if you have an older TV, you'll need to go for the 1 or 2. You might be able to get it to work with an HDMI to analog converter, but I don't have firsthand experience with that.I don't know if it's worthy of the upgrade if you have another Roku, but if you're looking for a new one anyway and have the extra cash (as I said, if you look around you can get a refurb for cheaper with a fully warranty on a certain widely known competitor of Amazon), then I'd definitely get the Roku 3."}, {"review_id": "395fbdecacf7dff8b114ea884405fb14", "review": "I have 2 apple TV's and this is much better than those. I also have the slightly earlier version of this Roku and that version is fantastic too but the additional features of this device are great. Volume and headphone jack on the remote... awesome.

But many nights when the rest of the family is in bed I can put the earphones on and listen without disturbing anybody. This alone was worth a new purchase at our house.Like the Roku 2 it occasionally hangs up but it is easily fixed by unplugging and replugging the power. This only happes about once every two months or so."}, {"review_id": "c70639d361115990ead6e4685bac4346", "review": "The Roku 3 is the latest device that I've added to my home in an effort to replace my cable box. No, the Roku 3 by itself cannot replace all the functions of a cable box but it is a great place to start. The device, about the size of a hockey puck, is truly impressive and functions better than more expensive alternatives.---------------SETUP:From start to finish setup is incredibly easy. I got my Roku up and running in less than 5-minutes. Included in the box are quick-start instructions, the power adapter, the remote (with batteries), and the Roku device. I used a small piece of sticky back Velcro to adhere my Roku to the back of my HDTV, although there are other alternatives sold here on Amazon such as the TotalMount Roku Mounting Kit. The Roku is light enough that even double sided tape would hold the device firmly in place. The only piece you need outside the box is a HDMI cable. The Roku 3 accepts both wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi. I chose the latter and I'm happy to say that Wi-Fi works perfectly. The main reason I avoided the Roku products before the R3 model was because I'd heard complaints of spotty Wi-Fi. This is not the case at all with the Roku 3. My wireless router is in my basement on the other side of my home and the R3 easily picks up a strong signal and delivers content consistently without interruption.Once the device is connected to your television and internet you'll need a computer or internet-enabled device to connect to Roku's website and register the device. This is accomplished via a simple pin-code that you'll type into the website. Once that's accomplished you can start adding channels in addition to those already loaded on the device. For folks who already subscribers to services like Netflix or Amazon VoD you can proceed to sign in or in Amazon's case enable the device by following the on-screen instructions.---------------USE:My wife has been making extensive use of the device as we recently welcomed our first child and she uses the device while at home to stream television shows and movies. The interface is incredibly smooth and very refined. No unnecessary navigation or sub-menus are present. Apps like Netflix, Amazon VoD, Vudu, Hulu, etc. are very responsive and easy to navigate. Comparing the Roku 3 to another device we recently purchased, the Western Digital Live TV Hub is a landslide victory for Roku. Other companies will have to play catch-up to Roku's little device as it's very impressive.--------------What I Love About the Roku 3:(+) The remote is fantastic and doesn't require line-of-sight with the R3 box to operate.(+) The remote has a built-in jack that supports headphones/earbuds. This is a great feature for anyone with kids or poor noise insulation in their home and lets you watch programs without disturbing anyone else.(+) The interface is customizable featuring everything from themes to app tiles that can be changed and adjusted. Best of all, the entire interface isn't slow or clumsy. Button presses on the remote immediately translate to a response on-screen.(+) Universal search. Looking for specific movie or TV show but not sure if it's available on Netflix or Amazon? Universal search allows you to search available channels for your content.(+) The small and inconspicuous design is perfect in our living room where we keep our electronics footprint as light as possible. The R3 is very easy to hide and slim enough to fit behind my wall-mounted HDTV.(+) The quality of the streaming content is consistently superior on the Roku 3 than on a similar device, the Western Digital TV Live Hub. I'm not sure if it comes down to the processor or exactly what. I even have my WDTV Live Hub using a wired Ethernet connection and it still displays an inferior resolution to the R3.(+) Has a built-in USB port for connecting external hard-drives with additional content. Also included is a SD-expansion slot for storing content and additional channels.(+) Andriod/iOS app support that allows you to channel surf, change the channel, or display content from your smart phone on your TV.---------------What I Don't Love about My Roku 3:(-) Does not support non-HDTVs. The inclusion of only HDMI output means that only a suitable HDTV will work with the Roku 3. This is probably less relevant today than it would have been a few years ago but still something to consider for non-HDTV owners. The R3 does not come with a HDMI cable.(-) Limited support for external files. For movies .mkv (h.264) and mp4 (h.264) are supported but nothing else. Supported music file formats include .aac  and .mp3. For photos it's only .jpg and .png.(-) No YouTube channel.---------------Overall:The Roku 3 is a fantastic little device that opens up a world of content at your fingertips. The device is inexpensive yet extremely well refined and polished in a way very few other products in this market have achieved. There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product. Recommended.---------------UPDATE: 7/2/13: I've been using my Roku 3 for about 3 months and in that time the remote has lost its connection to the base unit twice. I've noticed that on both occasions the remote will suddenly stop responding to certain commands. For example all of the arrow keys and the 'OK' buttons will stop functioning but I can still use the 'back' button. The easiest solution I've found is to simply power off the base unit by unplugging the AC adapter, waiting a few seconds, and plugging the adapter back in. The R3 does come with a troubleshooting guide in the manual that covers pairing a remote with the base unit but it was unnecessary in my experience."}, {"review_id": "4ebb5c6c4a011f04aceef4716d165216", "review": "After deciding to ditch cable TV I started to research alternative set-top-boxes that can provide on-demand content in addition to allowing live streams. The Roku showed up everywhere - blog posts about ditching cable, forums, and reviews. This encouraged me to take the plunge.I was quickly disappointed - the Roku is not a cable box replacement. Nearly it's entire library and design is only centred around the idea of on-demand content, not live streams. The Remote control included is ONLY Wifi, with no Infrared, so if you want to program your universal remote with it you're all out of luck. Neither me nor my spouse liked this included \"toy\" remote or the interface design.The big problem with it, in my opinion, is that each channel is completely separate. Say you want to watch a movie, or see what is streaming on a twitch channel or talk radio station - you have to go into that specific channel/app then look, and then go back to the home screen and move onto the next channel - rinse and repeat. If you've just got home from work and are tired you just want to relax in front of the TV, and the Roku does not provide that experience - if you have lots and lots of channels it's just not possible. This would be excusable if it was android based using existing apps, but this is a brand new platform, they could have done so much more, yet it offers nothing more than many gaming consoles or android mini-PCs.If the Roku could smartly combine my YouTube subscriptions, Netflix movies, and show me what shows were playing on live streams, all at the same time, it might be onto something. It would be great for independent content creators to make their own live streams that could be installed and immediately show up in a central guide. This limitation makes the technology feel early and I don't want to be an early adopter, especially if it doesn't feel like the device will ever become this.I will give some positives - the interface is very fast, certainly the fastest Youtube and Netflix interfaces I've ever seen on a non-PC. The design is slick and the way the Media Player can read NTFS drives is a good feature not often seen on devices like this.Ultimately I decided to return the Roku to Amazon. There are different devices slowly appearing which will offer better Cable box replacements as time goes on, here are a couple of examples:- \"Mohu Channels\" integrates Android Apps and Over the air TV into a single guide, due to be re-released sometime this year.- Channel Master DVR+ which also receives (and records) Over the air TV and includes Custom Apps in the guide (currently only Vudu but more are promised for this year)"}, {"review_id": "1d838e8bf14c55818db12e60f25d1d1f", "review": "I waited for over 2 months for this unit to hit the market and I kept watching videos of the neat little box and thought it might be away to curb the raising costs of my dish service and broaden my viewing options.

Once I got it unboxed I proceeded to do setup as directed  but Roku fails to inform us consumers at we need a HDMI cable which is not included  you can buy one from them or go to Radio Shack at get one for $29  yeah right  I go online find out the box store has them but it is $19.95 again $$$  No thanks I can order one though the same box store for $5.50 plus tax Ok.

The product is easy to set up and use though it takes some getting used to as it is different than watching cable or satellite TV as there are no set program times. The Roku, along with rabbit ears to access local channels, allowed me to eliminate my satellite TV subscription.I have high speed internet but only 3Mb--5Mb is min speed recommended--but the movies stream without glitches.

The PBS channel provides access to current shows not available on Cox OnDemand.  Would love to watch Fox Now and others like that but don't have access because of Cox (no fault of Roku). I am currently reformatting my movie ISO files into .mp4 containers so that I can stream directly from the Plex channel. The headphone works well and will certainly be put to use while working out on the elliptical. Never have any buffering issues as it is connected via the Ethernet option. Easy to install and works with my Logitech remote control. Just bought another for a Christmas gift.  Love it!!!"}, {"review_id": "2c385316bfdf9ae9808bcc8355f08cae", "review": "Let me first say that I have been a Roku user for a number of years now, and own a Roku  1 XD, XDS, and a Roku 2 XS. I have also owned and used in the past the Logitech Review using GoogleTV, the last two non-Google TV Sony boxes, and two generations of the WD TV Live streamers. After owning and using all those, the Roku is the only one that has a place in my livingroom, and here's why...Without boring everyone on the specs of the R's, let me start by telling about my experience setting it up.Once unpacked one simply plugs the power adapter into the wall and an HDMI cable into the TV and the Roku, that's it. The unit begins booting up then asks you to select whether you want to use a wireless or wired network connection. I selected wireless and it then shows a list of the networks it detected. Once you choose your network you input the password for your network and in a few seconds it connects right away.Finally it displays an activation code which you are to use to activate and attach the Roku to your online Roku account. For some seeking out a computer that may or may not be near the TV might be a pain, but I simply opened Safari on my iPhone and added the code to my account while sitting in front of the TV.Once the code is entered, as part of the attaching process you are prompted to add payment info just in case you want to buy a channel or game in the future. You can not bypass this but IT'S OK. Enter it in and finish the account set up. Once you do you can simply choose to delete the payment info and it's erased from the Roku servers.Once the account is made and successfully linked, the Roku automatically downloads the channels from your account (if you are attaching it to an existing account) or just quickly downloads the few selected during the account creation process, including \"Angry Birds Space\".That's it, its that easy to get it set and ready to stream. Of course with some premium channels you will either need to log in to your account from the Roku (Netflix) or similarly link the box to your online account using a computer, smartphone, or tablet browser (Amazon Instant Video).I have found that the set up is incredibly easy over the numerous boxes I've used over the last few years and always recommend a Roku to especially those less adept at setting up electronics/computers/networking items.The interface--The interface of the Roku units has always been a sore point.. When it started out with just Netflix and then just a few channels, the horizontal row of channel icons was fine, but now with HUNDREDS of channels it was sorely needing a refresh. The interface alone was one of the biggest reasons I was always trying different streaming boxes..I'm so pleased to see the new grid-style interface on the R3. Not only is it beautifully rendered, but it is very, very fast to navigate and to find whatever it is you want in your channel list. Very modern-looking and functional.One huge thing I notice over the older units in the interface is that besides it being \"pretty\", even the channels load much faster than previous units thanks to a new processor.The universal search function is great too, allowing you to search for movies, shows, and even actors across the major providers.The USB port--USB functionality is a great add-on for the top tier Roku. The Roku units are first and foremost internet streamers, but the convenience of plugging in a thumb drive and being able to play some of my personal movie collection is great. Video format is rather limited, but again this is an add-on feature not a main selling point. Because I'm an iTunes user, I rip all my movies/shows as H.264 MP4 files because thy are iPhone/iPad compatible, and just so happen they are compatible with Roku as well. Very nice.Programming----This is where Roku is just second to none, and why I choose to use it over all the others. Besides the big players like Netflix, Vudu, etc. Roku has such a wealth of programming that I actually hate it. I hate the fact I'm not independently wealthy and have to work for a living, and consequently don't have enough time in the day to watch everything on there I want to. You may very well feel the same way, but not to worry.. Unlike broadcast TV, everything on Roku is on-demand, meaning its there when you want it, not when its being broadcast.Now sure, there's no YouTube. That might or might not be coming so if you get one, just assume you won't have it. Cute little kitty videos are fun to watch on the TV, but there's tons more you can watch on other channels. I love the fact I can get live streaming news from the BBC or CNN International, or watch cheesy, badly dubbed Kung fu movies, or B-movie horror and sci-fi all night long for free from my Roku if I want lol. The Roku's available programming really is like a buffet, its all you can eat and there's something for everybody.The remote ---The remote is very comfortable in the hands and acts as a motion-controlled controller for gaming. It it also isn't infared like a traditional remote so that means it doesn't have to be pointed right at the TV in order to work. The private listening mode worked really nicely when I tried it and I can imagine many uses for it.Overall the Roku 3 is a great upgrade from the previous Roku 2, mostly because of the new UI (which will be coming to the roku 2 units in a month or two), the faster processor, and the wireless private listening mode. If you already have an R2 XS, I don't honestly think its worth upgrading since its biggest noticeable feature (the UI) will come in time.For some just now dipping their toes in the world of internet streaming, I personally would get this Roku 3 hands-down over any other competing player on the market. Its so easy to use and that's why not only is it what I use but what my elderly parents use too. The best thing about them is they keep getting better."}, {"review_id": "a759bb6ca0bb0caad79677444c48fcfe", "review": "After all my years in the computer industry, its become a very high expectation of mine that hardware and software be easy to setup and get started with. That being said the Roku 3 is the fifth Roku I have personally installed. It is amazing that its ease of setup continues to get ever better. Take it out of the box, peel off the protective plastic, hook up the HDMI cable to your TV or monitor and the back of the Roku 3, connect the power brick and a Ethernet cable and you're done. That's it, you can't complain about 3 cables now can you?Unlike many other products, the Roku has no power button, it consumes so little power it really doesn't need one. This means when you are ready to watch a show, there is no waiting. I knew from previous models (Roku 2) to put batteries (included) in the remote prior to going through setup. This ensures the Roku finds the remote and synchs up with it right away. Speaking of the remote, the new Roku 3 remote has an earphone jack built right into it's side. What a great feature, now when sitting in bed you can easily add earphones so as to watch TV without ever bothering the other half. The volume control is handled by two buttons on the opposite side of the remote, just where they should be. It is features like this that demonstrate the folks at Roku actually use their own products and pay close attention to detail. Small things like this really make the experience much more pleasurable.Once you have powered on, the mostly automatic setup is a breeze and super easy to deal with. Just for the sake of seeing how well it worked, I connected the Roku 3 through both a Ethernet cable and over wireless to my dual Netgear wireless router. Added the Mac: address to the router and had it reserve an IP. Ran the wireless detection and it configured first time through without a hitch. Then I switched the cable for the faster speed over the gigabit network. I can always fall back on the wireless in case something goes bonkers with the cables.Once the Roku 3 was up and running with my Roku account, it downloaded the new firmware, updated all my channels and I played a game of Angry Birds Space. Love the new remote, really works well for playing games like Angry Birds. As much as I like Angry Birds, it was time to put the Roku to it's best use, watching movies in HD on my 27&#34; monitor. Went straight to Amazon Prime, linked the new Roku to my account and rented SkyFall in full 1080P. The picture was outstanding, not one hiccup or stutter, and no buffering at all, not once. skyfall is a killer movie by the way, I highly recommend it:)All in all, the Roku 3 is just another prime example of how to do things right. Check out the new interface, search capability, and channel store look and feel, you won't be disappointed. Changing settings has never been easier. With a great new interface which allows you to go right where you need, to change between network types, interface themes, audio modes, time, etc. you'll be watching and playing within minutes of opening the box.This new Roku is a real pleasure to use, never even looked at the literature that came with it and was watching a new release HD movie in under 15 minutes, and two of those were waiting for the popcorn in the microwave. Next ill try the USB channel with one of my slim drives with all my media, but I have a bunch of movies to catch up on first! You can't go wrong with the Roku 3, the best Roku yet, five stars at least!"}, {"review_id": "7edcda78def15550ef9fdf9e08afa878", "review": "As an ex-patriot living overseas, I use ROKU as my sole means of getting American TV.  I previously had the Roku XD, which worked, but would lock up occasionally and Hulu never worked right.  I decided to try the newest version, the 3, and wow, what a difference.  It works flawlessly.  Hulu streams and navigates as fast as I can push the remote buttons.  The new interface is also much cleaner and usable.  My kids use the headphones in the remote frequently as well.The only &#34;issue&#34; I have with it is that they moved the &#34;OK&#34; button from in the middle where I was used to it, down below, so I have to think about it before I can hit the button.

The only problem I personally have is that the 700+ channels aren't all great. But the ones that are are well worth buying his streamer. It has so much potential for more channels to come to this device. As a heavy apple user and Apple TV owner I do miss that there isn't an airplay mirroring feature like apples but there are so many more features that make up for that.

For the past two years we've been using a VueZone system, but recently upgraded to a 10Mb Internet connection so wanted to try a full-frame-rate IP camera with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities.  The results were disappointing across the board:1. Poor depth-of-field.2. Smeared look to movement.3. Weak Wi-Fi reception.4. Slow response to pan, tilt, and zoom controls.5. Non-existent Tech Support6. Java requirement.Depth-of-Field--------------The image looked fuzzy at certain distances, so I placed it at the end of a 20' hallway and systematically adjusted the lens to find a focal point that would work for all distances near and far.  Never could.  Interestingly, our VueZone camera whose lens is non-adjustable has no difficulty keeping everything in focus.Smeared Movement----------------Compared to YouTube examples--and an understanding of how 30fps should look--our results disappointed.  They were certainly an improvement over the 4fps of our VueZone cameras, but not what 30fps should look like IMHO.  Looked somewhere between those two numbers.Weak Wi-Fi----------One of the big selling points of today's IP cameras is their use of Wi-Fi.  Surprisingly, this camera would not connect much beyond 15' and passing through one wall.  Found this surprising because our VueZone cameras sit 20' feet away and pass through two walls without problem.  One camera is 30' away and passes through three walls one of which is brick.  All the more surprising when you consider the DCS-5020L can act as a wireless extender.Slow Response-------------Pan, tilt, and zoom controls had a 2-4 second delay.  That's not horrible but borders on it.  Again, does not match what people post in YouTube reviews.Tech Support------------DLink has enjoyed a strong reputation for consumer tech products ever since its early success in routers.  So, I was surprised to learn their technical support consisted of FAQ pages on their web site.And, if you click on Contact Us you are taken to a content-management system where you type in your question and it does it's best to find an answer other owners have rated as \"helpful\" in the past.Pretty lame.  Again, using VueZone as our point of reference, at least with them you can call and talk to a person.Java Requirement----------------Simply put, if you use the myDlink web site to access your camera you gotta have Java enabled.  And, since 2011 Java is known to be one of the biggest malware vectors on the Net.  Apple quit shipping products with it pre-installed right after that announcement.Conclusion----------On the plus side, the camera is attractively designed, quiet when tilted or panned, and incorporates an IR-cut filter.  Unfortunately it fails in the critical areas of providing a clear image with reasonable Wi-Fi range.  For that and the reasons outlined above, it will be returned for a refund.

This speaker is made very well, it has a full metal body that surrounds the outside of the speaker and its contents. The bass is very powerful and the sound quality is, as you'd expect from Bose, phenomenal.I get decent range with bluetooth in my house, about 30 feet. I have never had the speaker die due to the battery just draining. I charge it maybe, once a week, if that.Overall it is a well designed portable speaker that is aesthetically pleasing, has great sound quality, and well worth the price.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a portable speaker but unsure which one to choose."}, {"review_id": "e1444d13892362afe126f8015ce4b8da", "review": "I listened to many speakers before deciding on this one from Bose.

I like the mini over the Boom because it has more bass.I have also purchased a Bose Soundlink (the larger one) and I would have to say that the sound quality on this one is much better than on that one and thus far this hasn't made the crackling or popping noises that the Soundlink has.I highly recommend this speaker."}, {"review_id": "a1012cacfa6e34a7fc79d698d1fee3a0", "review": "Stop considering this product and just buy it.

The Astro E5 size is exactly the same size as it predecessor, the Astro E4. The weight of it is pretty heavy holding it in your hand but not anything that is noticeable if you have a bunch of stuff in a bag with this battery in it. The on/off button is quite easy to press and easily pressed if it is stuffed into a bag. The flashlight in the external battery is a big plus. It is a bright LED light that works well if the power is out or looking for something in the night. The light is easily turned on because of the easily pressed on/off buttons. The flashlight is activated by pressing 2 times fast on the on/off button. This battery has 2 USB ports. One is 5 volts at 2 amps and the other is 5 volts at 1 amp. There are 4 LED's that tell how much power the battery pack has left for charging other devices. The battery has a smooth, shiny, reflective and stylish finish which looks awesome. The finish on the battery also attractions a lot of fingerprints which could make the battery look bad if not cleaned every so often.This battery has a massive 15000mah lithium ion battery in it that is packed in a small casing. This battery is smaller than most other external batteries I have researched in the past which is ideal for packing in a small bag. I use this battery to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPod touch 5. I can charge both these devices simultaneously.This product is ideal for someone who travels a lot and uses a smartphone for their business when traveling. This battery is also good for people who go camping and are not around power that watch movies and play games on their device for long periods of time. Other than the buttons being easily pressed this is the perfect external battery for those looking into buying one to use for a long trip or power your friends device and keep your devices charged in case of a black out.The Anker Astro E5 is closely comparable to the Astro E4.Anker Astro E4 13000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7... (This has a 13000mah lithium ion battery) Both of these batteries look identical from the looks to the locations of the ports but the Astro E5 has a 15000mah battery that puts it over the top of the Astro E4.Overall the Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery that can charge your smartphone to 100% and do it again 6-8 more times and has a modern look most smartphones have today. You won't have to worry about your phone dying for more than a week when using this external battery.So far i have charged my iPhone 5 twice and it still has 4 LEDS.Another Update: i have charged my ipod touch 2 times and my iPhone 5 3 times and it now has 1 LED and can still charge my devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest."}], "B00D856NOG": [{"review_id": "5a7ba251e744eb05ba2748ae48032f02", "review": "The stand is solid and sturdy, made of great materials and does its job.

Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and  16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google \"Install Flash On Nexus 7\"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10\" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like \"do I need an umbrella today?\" Ask \"Weather forecast (your location).\"Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the \"NAvFree USA\" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying \"in 100 meters, turn right.\" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7\" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10\" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates."}], "B00DIOALPE": [{"review_id": "102ca0aebae09b82387877324954ece6", "review": "I just ordered a white pair from Amazon.

As far as I see - this has to be why you want it.If you buy a chromecast and wish it came with a remote, then you should just buy a Roku or blu-ray player with wifi apps.The ability to navigate on a tablet and queue up shows on the TV is the main draw here.If you think about it - when you imagine a millionaire watching TV, the remote you picture is probably similar to a large smartphone or tablet, right? So Chromecast allows you to use your expensive smartphone to enhance the TV navigation experience.For that, I think the price is just right.Netflix and youtube worked well. I tried casting video from my computer chrome browser and it did not work well.Choppy, and it really had the computer working hard to stream the video.If they figure out how to get the Chromecast to stream directly from a URL rather than streaming through your computer - they would have a real valuable feature.

HuluPlus and Amazon on Demand seem to have packet streaming that deals with that pretty well--I have to restart movies during peak hours, two or three times, but other than that I don't have much interruption.But, I thought this didn't work at all with a two-year-old Dell laptop because it couldn't connect during peak hours. (It wouldn't work at 10 p.m. on a Monday night). Then, my boyfriend got it to \"Cast\" using a Samsung phone at about 11:00 p.m.. We like to watch very old Led Zeppelin videos on YouTube, and it did work well for that. The video and audio with even really old footage is excellent.The next day, I had no problem at all getting it to cast at 1:00 a.m., from my laptop.  As of this writing, though, I don't think it works unless your cable is really good.If you have bad internet, this isn't worth the money.  The free Netflix is nice, though."}, {"review_id": "502822e8e04dee38f33138119a22674d", "review": "I see more than one thousand reviews are here. Let me keep this simple. I don't have a netflix account neither i use google video&music.; I watch some youtubes but those are short clips. I do watch amazon prime videos but no chromecast apps are available for that. Still, as you know, these is a way though.When you set up your chromecast, wifi connection is required even if you are using the wired lan cable. Here is the point.WIFI IS NOT REQUIRED AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP.The reason casting your chrome browser lags is this. When casting youtube, it's pretty much the dongle that is doing most of the job. That's why it works great. However, when you casting your browser, two way traffics are going on. That's why it lags. Most wireless connections are slower than wired lan. Well some hi-tech wireless would certainly beat wired but that's not for many of us. Then, if we can make at least one way faster, we can assume that casting with your browser would be much better.(I assume you know how to do it. 1)Get the chrome browser for PC 2) download the extension named as google cast 3) put folder's path on the browser 4) browse and run the file 5) click the extension on the right top and cast 6)if you are just casting the screen of your chrome then you don't need 3)and4))Okay, once I set up, I took off my wifi usb adapter for my desktop and connect it with lan cable. Nothing fancy, just a simple cat5e cable. Do I have an expensive router? No way. Mine is refurbished Cisco Valet M20. Got it less than $20.My computer is a bit high-tech. But I assume it doesn't matter since my laptop returned the same result.The difference is huge. With two-way WIFI, I can't even make it with high 720p option on the chrome browser. The amazon video lags so bad that I had to set it to 480p. Playing local video files was worse. I played 2 gb 720p mkv file just FYI.With wired and WIFI, it works great. I would say it's 90% perfect. With wired cable, I can set it to extreme 720p and it still works great. NO lags whatsoever. amazon prime videos or local media files. Since I don't have 1080p files in my HDD, I couldn't test it. However, 720p mkv file worked just great. This means ANY STREAMING on your PC chrome will cast to your tv with the dongle without lagging. hulu, hbo, vemeo.. you just name it.I know the chromcast app on your PC will still ask for wifi connection. However, it works without it as long as you are connected to the same router.Well, hope this helps for those non-netflix users but still thinking about buying this."}, {"review_id": "af6ad0124b6114a056ede394911b3ca8", "review": "i bought the chromecast with the specific intention of using it to stream from my nas media library. i waited until recently to get one because i wanted to make sure the android apps were available to meet my needs. as it turns out, i found two apps to do this perfectly: NAS Cast ($1.67) and LocalCast (free with paid ad removal). now i can stream all my local content without having to fire up the ps3!as an added bonus, i received my chromecast on the first day of the coachella music festival, which was streamed live all weekend on youtube. using my chromebook, i cast the youtube live feed to the chromecast and enjoyed free, live music all weekend!ok, bottom line. everyone interested in a chromecast has a pretty good idea of what it can do. with the potential of this device, the price tag makes it an easy choice over roku, wd live, or appletv. i'm considering adding one of these to every tv in my house! the cost of a couple more is about the same as i used to pay every month for cable tv, and with the ever-increasing compatibility of the chromecast with media sites and services, this thing could very easily become the main media delivery device in my home."}, {"review_id": "37e5ed26202b9cf9202e469d982f07c6", "review": "Can't believe this thing is so cheap for what it does.

My TV is properly equipped so that the chromecast can turn the TV on and switch it to the proper input when casting begins. I haven't tried attaching the chromecast to my AV system yet but I've heard certain AV systems can do it.The only thing that lags is full screen hulu from computer to chromecast but I believe that is an issue with data speeds of my wifi.

I simply couldn't set it up through chrome. I checked all the router settings as it was suggested by the installer, even reseted my router, but to no avail. After going though all forums and troubleshooting pages, I realized that the firewall on my Macbook Pro is on, and that's the reason. When I disabled the firewall, it was set up in no time.But things got better after that grueling installing experience. I have hooked the Chromecast up to my LG 39LN5300, and it works (almost) perfectly. I use it to watch youtube, Netflix, or to stream (some) online videos using VidCast bookmarklet. From time to time, it doesn't work, but a simple reload of the chrome page almost always solves the problem. I also tried tab-casting, but it's not something to write home about. You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance). This is what sets apart Chromecast from Apple TV and Roku.

If you try to follow the instructions on your ethernet-wired desktop to set it up, you will get an error saying, &#34;No big deal, but your wifi is off.&#34;  This refers to your computer, not the dongle itself.  Once I downloaded the iOS Chromecast app from Apple on my iPhone I was able to get the device to connect.  Once set up, the desktop computer running Google Chrome can &#34;cast&#34; to the Chromecast.  In this case you will need to download the Google Cast Extension to your Chrome browser.  It will automatically find your Chromecast device and allow streaming from the browser.Unfortunately, two phone calls to Chromecast support failed to even ask me how the computer I was using to set up was connected to the internet... a very important and obvious thing to ask it seems to me!  One rep actually told me my router wouldn't work unless I turned off security (not an issue since Chromecast is compatible with both WEP and WAP).  Another rep sent me an email with instructions on how to install from an Android phone when I specifically told her I had an iPhone.  I suppose the tech support will catch up as these devices become more common and are used by non-techies.All it all, if you read all you can (the reviews here are very helpful and accurate) and understand what it can and cannot do, you will be happy with this device."}, {"review_id": "81b2a7624b0f23cc8ba5fa8790dba211", "review": "I own an Apple TV and just bought this as a do Android development.

Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used. I'm going to hang on to it though to see if they release updates for it that make it better.

The setup was very simple.My review is probably shorter than the Chromecast deserves, but I don't have any significant complaints, it has totally changed the way I use my receiver. It is now set to use the Chromecast source 90% of the time. I can pick out a movie from my phone, and I can resume the song I was just listening to in the car once I open my front door.

The device is controlled via mobile devices or pc/laptop using the chromecast mobile app. I have the app on my iphone and Nexus 7 (android). Integration with the devices is OK but can be improved in terms of interface however playback for Netflix and Google Play was flawless for me.Setup is super easy and simple. You basically don't need to type in almost any information other than naming you device (optional but useful if you have more than one). Just plug it in, and let the app on you phone/device set up itself. Note however that the chromcast turns off when not in use so you have to turn on your tv and switch to the chromecast to wake it up so you can set it up (say on another device).I hope this device will support other apps in the future, like Amazon for example.

What Chromecast does is to cast \"cast-supported\" apps from your smart phones, tablets, and stream media from your laptops and PCs to the TV on the same local network (LAN).Setup is easy and straight-forward. Connect Chromecast to your TV, download Chromecast apps from Google Play / iTune to your device, making sure Wifi-is on, setup Chromecast's Wifi connection via your mobile device, and it is done. Setup only needs to be done once. Other supported devices connected to the same local network will then all be able to use the same Chromecast.Now Google Play has a section dedicated to Chromecast compatible apps. For some reason, this section is only shown via Google Play app, not browser version, but going to chromcast.com/apps would also give you the list. Currently the selection is quite limited, with a great deal of them just variations of apps for streaming media from your local computers and media servers to Chromecast. Others like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and so on frequently requires paid subscription to truly make a difference.Basically, Chromecast combines your mobile device and TV into a fast-response SmartTV.The Touch-Ups which could potentially make Chromecast a perfect device:Currently, the only way to cast PC Desktop screens onto Chromecasted TV is to download the Google Chrome extension \"Google Cast\" by Google (sorry, mobile Google Chrome is currently not supported). It gives your the option to stream a dedicated browser Tab or cast the entire desktop screen. However, there are some flaws:1. In general, casting would mess up your Google Chrome \"non-maxed\" window size. It is a mild annoyance, but still annoying anyhow.2. Tab cast mode has no option to display mouse cursor. Not an issue for portable laptops, but a serious issue for a casting PC from another room.3. Desktop cast mode does display mouse cursor, but it could only cast the whole desktop. If you have a multiple monitor setup, it practically makes the cast useless.4. Neither Tab mode nor Desktop mode have build-in PC control mechanism. Although this could be easily fixed by using app such as \"Unified Remote,\" it is still one extra step.*How 4. works, Google Cast to cast PC desktop + Unified Remote on your tablet/smart phone to control the PC -> result displays on TV**Better solution: Chomecast app integrates with Google Cast. It still needs PC, TV, and mobile device to work, but require one less app to install.If the above touch-ups could be implemented, Google Chromecast could be a potentially monopoly-accused TV casting device."}, {"review_id": "ce03e5e33a259e48ddfbfbc8799ef317", "review": "I bought this to try out because i was on the fence as to whether I wanted to replace my 60&#34; TV With a new Smart TV. I am glad that I decided to do this first. I watch a lot of stuff on Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. It is by far the best way to get these on my non-smart TV. The box comes with everything you need to get started. If your TV does not have a USB port it even comes with a adapter so you can plug it into a wall socket. The set up was quick and easy, and took less than 5 minutes. It works wirelessly so there is no need to have Ethernet cable to my TV. You can also stream your music from google play or pandora as well. I just ordered two more devices for my other home TV's this way no matter what room I'm in, or my family can watch one thing in one room on Netflix and I can watch a different movie on another TV. Another benefit is that anything I can bring up in my Chrome browser I can put on the TV. So I can show people my pictures or bring up a web page for all to see. I have even done my gmail with it.

Super cheap and has a pretty decent wifi capabilities to stream HD content from the existing apps.BUT, if you want this primarily to mirror your browser or entire desktop (yes, you can do that with this device except the audio), this product is in serious beta stage. I tried to cast Hulu (not plus) and the audio was fine but the video was not HD at all. Same with Netflix. I was excited about their Beta feature of casting the entire desktop but realized that in that case the video is pretty decent, but it does not cast the audio to the TV speakers.If Google keeps updating the apps and the hardware, I will definitely give their version 2.0 another chance."}, {"review_id": "79019253aa6523f566c4d604de6b46f8", "review": "I've had the Chromecast for about a week now, and despite a few little hiccups have been incredibly impressed and pleased.  Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting.  I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID.  The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue.  Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network.  I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button.  No luck.  I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck.  It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect.  Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again.  But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One.  Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc.  Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than.  You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays.  At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content.  Super slick.I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect.  You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV.  Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have).  I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up.  And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays.  Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy.  My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen.  I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons.  Had to \"back\" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up.  Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough.  It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection.  If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there.  If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.Very, very pleased."}, {"review_id": "4e0a6b75f59941152f2276182e52219a", "review": "Simply put, the Chromecast is fantastic. For the price, especially if you got in when they had the Netflix deal, this was almost impossible to pass up. Now, I'm a bit of a tech guy and have a computer plugged into every TV in my house, but this is still great for sharing YouTube and Netflix videos to the big screen without having to go switch inputs and grab my keyboard. I like the CEC support to turn on and change the input of your TV automatically the most.I can only give 4 stars out of 5 though because while the product is fantastic and the price is right, it still hasn't been adopted by many other apps than the initial few. Hulu recently added support, but Google has been fairly quiet about the product since announcing it. Still, even if you just used it for YouTube, Netflix, and/or Hulu, it's so cheap it's still a great buy. I'd really like to see Google use this technology more though and it would be worth a full 5 stars.For those comparing with Apple TV or Airplay, I don't see any reason for these products to co-exist as they do very similar tasks. The difference though is that using Airplay requires you to buy an Apple TV at minimum which is a good bit more expensive. Simply put though, if you're an Apple person with a lot of Apple products, you may be happier with an Apple TV using Airplay. Otherwise, this cheaper alternative can perform similarly if not even better once Google and other companies (hopefully) start to utilize it more."}, {"review_id": "bd0cc4881d2d9cc200d241c7a661a7aa", "review": "This thing is cheaper than a Roku box, and finally I can get YouTube videos on my TV.

It definitely makes TV watching easy, economical and practical.  Big different that consumers should be aware of, this is not a Roku or an Apple TV competitor.  Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.  Same applies for the phone, i only have apps that are compatible with Chromecast so no issues there.  But i am sure in this community of users that have different needs that maybe an impact somewhere down the line, but for 35 bucks amazing product.Pros:-  Easy to setup.  Not difficult at all but it does require a degree of understanding of your TV an knowing your wifi password.-  Delay is pretty amazing, from computer to Chromecast only about a 1 second delay.  Beats the pants off of Netgear's products and Windows 8 screen display technology-  Audio quality is great, its an HDMI adapter so make sure you have HDMI on your TV-  The software needed to run is simple to use.  One click of a button and its up and running.-  Small and non intrusive.Cons:-  Google needs to add better user instructions on setup.  I know they have a guide but it would be nice on screen-  A win 32 agent or a .dmg app would be nice.  I understand its more to maintain but for this type of technology it would be nice to be able to see local machine videos and movies.

I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.As a product, my feelings are explained below.Pros:- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.Cons:- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding? We are talking about WiFi AC standard and this crap doesn't support part of Wireless-N (5GHz)!! This will have impact on 1080p video (sampled at 20+ mbps while shooting) streaming for sure.- Very limited app support at the moment; it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google Play (music and video). heck! my TV has both YouTube and Netflix app built-in and my android phone has YouTube Remote App; another $35 on such a device is not worth (at least at this moment).- HD video streaming is not as smooth as expected. It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have. Plus, many people tried playing local content by opening those in Chrome browser and then casting it, but result is not good. The contents are too slow."}, {"review_id": "4e89a2bcb243cb779735330d6b5d056d", "review": "The Google Chromecast device is worth what you pay for it.For playing TV and shows and movies from Google Play, Netflix, Hulu Plus and other places it was specifically designed for - it does an acceptable job. However occasionally, even though I do have a fast Internet Connection - it will pause for buffering.At this time, I am not sure if the buffering is the device's fault - or due to the fact my tablet doesn't have an overly fast processor.My biggest qualm and the reason I will not rate the device a full five stars is due to the Google Cast application that runs in Google Chrome on your desktop or laptop.Trying to use this app for streaming video from your laptop or desktop is a joke. In using it, no matter what setting you utilize - the Chromecast device will drop it's WiFi connection every few minutes.And needless to say, Google's forum support might as well be non-existent. I submitted this problem to the Google forum several weeks ago and still have not received even a single response.Botttom line: In using the designed apps specifically built for this device (except Google Cast), the Chromecast device does well and it's worth the $$$.

Youtube and Netflix both play video in 1080p and using your device as a remote is almost as responsive as a real remote. I did have some issues with the youtube app on my laptop; sometimes a video ad would play on my laptop and when the ad was done I would no longer have control over the video that was being played on the Chromecast.The function to automatically turn on the tv did not work for either my tv, which is a few years old, or my parent's tv, which is a few weeks old.The laptop screen share essentially works as a wireless hdmi cable, but it has a few expected flaws. Initially, my router was upstairs and I was testing on my middle floor, and it was impossible to screen share a video. It was far too laggy and glitchy (testing on South Park Studios and HBO Go). I then moved the router down to the middle floor and placed it near my tv, and the performance was greatly improved to the point where I was able to stream video. Even though the performance was improved, I would rather just stream video with a cable under most circumstances. The screen sharing resolution is also maxed out at 720p. Hopefully more content providers will make their own apps, which clearly perform better than the screen sharing.The Chromecast is nice for laptops/desktops and incredible for mobile devices. The ability to starting playing a video, then turn off your screen or start doing something else is not possible with just a hardwired connection (for mobile).There are a few things that I still haven't tested, such as multiple mobile devices queueing up a Youtube playlist, but overall for only $35 I highly recommend it.

The Nexus though is super for quick searches for dining, tickets, etc. The speak to search function works beautifully.

The included on line manual is helpful."}, {"review_id": "8053d68c595a4e6dad46cde407802911", "review": "Earlier I did a review on my Nexus 7 on some tech forums, so I will just copy and past it here:I have been an iOS user for quite some time. When the Nexus 4 came out I decided to give it a shot and I loved it. I started using my iPad less and less because I enjoyed Android so much. Getting an Android tablet was next on my list, but I really wanted to wait for the 2013 Nexus 7 before trying it out. Once the Nexus 7 was announced, I quickly ordered one.The very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was its weight, or lack of. This thing is amazingly light and amazingly thin. Of course, the whole &#34;lighter and thinner&#34; quote is often said by Apple, but it can be easily applied to the new Nexus 7.Of course, the screen is another great thing about it. The 323 ppi is just 3 ppi short of the retina display on the iPhone. And for a device that will typically be held further away than a 4&#34; screen, this display is fantastic. It can be extremely bright and colors look fairly good so far. Viewing angles are pretty good. But my biggest complaint about the screen is how glossy it is. I would love to see more manufacturers start to implement the same kind of anti-glare glass that was put on the RMBP. Of course, this is dependent on Gorilla Glass, but hopefully they will start trying to decrease glare. Also, fingerprints get pretty obvious after a fair amount of use. But that is to be expected. The back of the device also seems to enjoy fingerprints. But this doesn't bother me on the back. And the back of the device has a nice finish to it making it comfortable to hold.The weight, size, and resolution of the Nexus 7 makes it a fantastic eReader. However, when it comes to web browsing the screen does feel small. This makes me wish it was a Nexus 8 instead of a Nexus 7, but I guess that could have increased the price. This is one area where I think Apple did a great job. Just a 1&#34; difference really does a lot to improve overall user experience when browsing the web. Sure, you can argue resolution, ppi, and throw all sorts of small numbers at the iPad Mini to make it look awful in comparison. But the screen size and aspect ratio really make it a great device for browsing the web and reading.When it comes to movies, the Nexus 7 is great. Although the 16:10 aspect ratio means you will still see black bars on the top and bottom on nearly every movie you watch. But the sound coming from the Nexus 7 is amazing. Google and Asus did a great job with dual speakers. However, in landscape mode the speakers are right where you are going to put your hands. So you may end up muffling the sound a little bit. The front bezels would have made a much better spot to put the speakers. Then they would have at least had some sort of excuse for the Texas-sized bezels. In fact, I watched a review online and the new Nexus 7 is taller than the old one. Meaning the top and bottom bezels are slightly bigger than last year!The simulated surround sound is a nice addition. And music sounds great. With movies, I have them all on Plex. So I am not sure how the Nexus 7 handles audio playback through Plex when watching a movie. And I know this may never happen, but it would be great if Google could do what they did with Google Music to personal movie collections. Obviously they would be worried about pirated movies. But I have a lot of DVDs that I got on my computer using HandBrake. And having that kind of functionality would be great. But I'm not holding my breath.The cameras seem to be decent. I have not tested them extensively yet, but for a tablet all you really need cameras for are for video chatting. And every video chat service will have to decrease the quality for streaming anyways.Wireless charging is a cool addition. It seems to work with my Nexus 4 wireless charger. However, I am still not a fan of Qi charging. Calling it wireless is just deceptive. Are wires still involved? Yes. Thus, not wireless. Plus using it on a wireless charger makes it much more difficult to use while the device is charging. If I have my Nexus 7 plugged into the cable, I can still play games that use the accelerometer. Can't easily do that with a wireless charger. Plus wireless chargers take longer to completely charge the device.Battery life is hard to determine at the moment since I just got it. I will need to update this section when I have more time with the device.Now that I have used it a full day, battery life isn't as good as I had hoped. Not even close really. I will post screen shots.The 2GB RAM and S4 Pro help the Nexus 7 feel speedy. However, it is still not perfectly smooth. Some parts of the UI will encounter some hiccups every now and then. Specifically dealing with the recent apps button and in some cases the home button freezing for a second or two. Nothing major, but this device still encounters minor lag.I find it odd that there is no vibrator motor in the Nexus 7. Sure, it may not be a priority, but adding one couldn't cost too much.Now that I have gone over the hardware, time to touch on the software. Android 4.3 is a minor update, and maybe it should have just been 4.2.3.Tablet app selection is still far inferior to iPads. Although, the Nexus 7 feels less like a tablet and more like a large phone. I'm not really sure how to explain this part, but is just doesn't feel like a tablet. Of course, 7&#34; is considered the smallest size screen a tablet can be, so I guess that makes sense. But when you have 5&#34; phones, 10&#34; tablets, and then a device with a 7&#34; screen, the screen size is closer to phones than tablets.Most apps work fine and are the exact same as the phone app, just scaled up. Some of the default Google Apps, like People and Calendar, are slightly different. But they feel squeezed, especially People.When it comes to third party apps, most function fine. However, Evernote keeps crashing on me. It will not open at all. Same with Slice. Whether or not this is due to Android 4.3 or the device itself, I don't know. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?Also, I am starting to find apps that are incompatible with the Nexus 7. I have never had this problem before with the Nexus 4. But one game I play quite often, Blitz Brigade, is not compatible. What's weird is that the Nexus 7 has the same CPU and RAM as the Nexus 4! Why it is incompatible I have no idea. But this is very frustrating.Ultimately, the best things about the Nexus 7 are its price, screen, and speakers. Android is a great phone OS, but it just doesn't feel as good on a tablet. The Android tablet experience definitely feels lacking in certain ways. But I expect this to improve as the OS matures.One thing in particular I do not like about the tablet experience is the lack of synchronized notifications. For example, I just got a notification from the default calendar app about an event coming up. I got the notification on both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. And I have the same Google Calendar synced on both devices. Yet if I dismiss the notification on one device, I am still required to dismiss it on the other device. Synchronized notifications is something that is sorely needed in Android.The Nexus 7 is a great and affordable way to get a foot in the Android tablet arena. If you are on the fence about it, you should definitely buy it and give it at least a week and see how you like it."}, {"review_id": "d1798be958c6e21d62f20e7846950108", "review": "I have been using hand held computers for a long time.

(so some of you should stop reading now) The new Nexus 7 really gives the Kindle Fire a run for its money as an entertainment device. I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD. Since many, if not most of my books are Amazon, that is a bummer - I like text to speech for when I am driving and listening at bedtime. Audible's audiobooks works fine on both.Web Browsing. Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about. But there are a half dozen I would like that aren't on Amazon's store.- Kindle Fire's built-in ebook reader will display both Amazon and non-Amazon books and will do text to speech on them all.I own both, but if I had pick just one today, I'd pick the Nexus 7. BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, \"normal\" socket. And the Nexus buttons are tiny and I find myself fumbling to find them.If you have an older model and are thinking of upgrading, perhaps waiting to see what Amazon responds to the Nexus 2013 with would be good. To be totally honest, I am now a fan of both tablets.

I own a TF700T.  A good tablet to be sure but it's at times too big and heavy for extended use.  The Nexus 7 is the perfect size and fits in my hand comfortably.

Normally, with most mobile devices, I struggle to hear music or movies with the volume up all the way.

Then there's the lack of microSD card support.  There's not enough room on the device for all my music and because this is the wifi only version, I'm not always going to have access to my music on the cloud.These minor drawbacks prevent me from giving it 5 stars...but I knew these things going into the purchase.

Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet). However, Android 4.3 feels ultra-smooth so far, and I am hoping that Google and Asus learned from their original mistakes.SCREEN: The new screen is absolutely stunning. Some people argue that the resolution of 323 pixels per inch is unnecessary, but you can really see the difference when you use it in person. Text is significantly sharper and a little easier on the eye to read. Using the tablet to watch videos and see pictures produces a stunning result.PROCESSOR: This is the #1 reason I'd recommend this new, upgraded Nexus 7 over the older version. The speed upgrade is unquestionably immense, and to those who have used the older and newest model Nexus 7, you will notice and appreciate this immediately. Apps load instantly; the internet browsing experience is smooth and a very welcome upgrade over past performance. It's strange; a few days ago I was satisfied with the decent albeit declining performance of my 1st Gen Nexus 7. Now that I have this new one, I use them both side by side and the older model feels like a dinosaur. This alone is reason enough to upgrade.SIZE/WEIGHT: The reduced thickness and weight of the tablet is very noticeable. I often times used my old Nexus 7 tablet while sitting in bed, to check email and browse the web prior to going to sleep. Holding the old Nexus in one hand, and the new one in the other, the differences in size and weight are VERY noticeable. No doubt will provide a more comfortable long term usage experience, especially for extended sessions while on flights or the subway.BATTERY LIFE: After a couple days of using this new Nexus 7, I can confidently say that the battery life has been significantly improved over the original model. My previous session of about 2 hours straight of use (screen on, using apps that draw semi-frequent data over wi-fi) drained only 20% of the battery life. If I project this out, it would tell me that I could get 10 hours of constant use on one full charge. I haven't run through an entire charge yet from 100% down to 0% (I've been recharging after each use), but I'll try to get to that sometime this week and report back on my total real-world battery life.CAMERAS: Google added a rear-facing Camera on this new second gen Nexus. While I typically wouldn't use my tablet as a camera, I have tried it out and it takes excellent pictures. Focuses quickly, the images are sharp and the low light performance, while not great, is better than I would have expected. The front-facing camera gets more use for me (I use my tablets to Skype with family). The new front facing camera is noticeably sharper and better in lower light situations than the original Nexus 7 camera was. In low light, the old model was almost unusable. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 low light performance is very acceptable.SPEAKERS: I've now spent some time using this second-gen Nexus 7 side by side with my original Nexus 7. Separately, they both sound very acceptable for speakers from small tablets. Using them side by side, the improvements to the Nexus 7 are very noticeable, and the sound is more clear even at high volumes. I'd say that this new model sounds far less \"tinny\" than the original Nexus did. Personally, I don't use the built-in speakers often (I'm normally either listening with headphones, or using bluetooth audio to my Logitech Boombox). But for people who do use the built-in speakers to play music or watch movies, you will appreciate the improvement in the speakers.OTHER FEATURES: Last night, I realized that this tablet is compatible with Qi Wireless Charging, a discovery which made me VERY happy. I use a Nexus 4 cell phone, and I keep it on my nightstand on the Google Nexus Charging Orb. I attempted to use the orb with this new Nexus 7 tablet, and it worked perfectly. You have to sit the tablet landscape, with the orb centered on the tablet, and it synced up and began charging instantly.COMPARISONS: I will update this section shortly with my comparison review between this 2nd Gen Nexus 7, the iPad Mini, and the Kindle Fire HD, as soon as I've had more time to test them all side by side.GRIPES AND COMPLAINTS: Here, I'll list any gripes that I have about the tablet. My first major gripe is that I am not a huge fan of the texture/material used on the back of the tablet. It's a slightly rubberized feeling coating, which I assume they did to create additional grip. However, I've been finding that after holding with one hand for a few minutes, I notice the tablet starting to slide a little bit in my hand. I think this is a combination of the new texture plus the fact that it's thinner than it used to be. I'm probably going to be purchasing a case for it shortly, which should alleviate this problem, but it is still worth noting. This is just a personal preference things (if you normally hold it landscape w/ two hands, you'll probably prefer this new texture over the old one).All in all, I am VERY impressed with how much faster this tablet is than my original Nexus 7 tablet. As long as this model doesn't suffer the performance slowdown issue of the original Nexus 7, I don't anticipate moving this away from a 5 star product anytime soon, but only time will tell I guess. I will keep this review updated as I go, and add thoughts on more features once I test them out further (the speakers, longer term battery life tests, performance slowdown, etc). If you have anything else you want me to address, please let me know in the comments section and I will be glad to address it."}, {"review_id": "7a424600b6a1e9459bc30a17af4e9f5f", "review": "I bought the older Nexus 7 and was wildly impressed by its performance. After a few weeks I decided to donate that one to a family member so I could have my own newer model. Either one is great, and performs like a dream. The new screen on the \"FHD\" is gorgeous, battery life is great and I've had zero issues with it.I waited quite a while for a six inch tablet. This is the closest I could get to that without going the smartphone route. I don't use my phone much, pay $11 a month and don't want to pay for a cell phone account. This still fits in a pocket, but it's a tight fit and I have loose fitting jeans.For the price, it's insane how much you can get from this tablet. I highly recommend it. I can't understand anyone's justification for going the iPad Mini route when you can have twice the quality and performance at 1/3rd the price.If you know you can get apps you need for Android, then just go with a tablet that isn't stamped with the \"Apple\" label. The only time I could't justify someone getting an iOS tablet is musicians, which have many apps for direct guitar plug-in, piano/keyboard and many other music-based effects that are hard to find (for now) on Android.Otherwise, there's no reason to waste your money on something that just has a company's logo on it as proof of \"quality\"."}, {"review_id": "c323dc7df69a795a87f31fd3909b8135", "review": "Tablets of all kinds are a lot of fun for me, and as an owner of last year's Asus Google Nexus 7 Tablet (8 GB) - Quad-core Tegra 3 Processor, Android 4.1, I was keen on giving Google and ASUS' most recent effort a short.  The tablets I've owned that I could compare this one to included theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,Apple iPad MD366LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) 3rd Generation,ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)(with matching dock), the aforementioned Nexus 7,Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 16 GB), and myMicrosoft Surface (32GB).  The Nexus 7 has turned out to be a worthy addition to this collection.  Here's why.PROS+ Lightweight build.  Last year's Nexus 7 was hardly a slouch in this department, and was more than portable enough for most.  The iPad Mini (which I purchased as a gift) is slightly thinner, but it doesn't really make any drastic improvements.  This device is markedly lighter than both, which makes it surprisingly easier in the hands.  You wouldn't think there was much room for improvement here (given the first generation was quite nice), but ASUS managed to pull it off.+ Great, understated looks.  Sure, the top and bottom bezels are a little larger, but compared to last year's Nexus 7, this device has a lot more \"class\" to it.  The exterior bezels now lack the bright silver banding, which helps the screen melt away into the bezels.  That's all the better, since as an LCD panel (which won't achieve the same black-levels as a AMOLED display from Samsung) is the centerpiece of this device, it's best to keep your focus on it.  The back is nice and smooth, with the word \"NEXUS\" inscribed into the back.  The branding is non-obtrusive and otherwise non-existent on a device that all around has a sophisticated, matte look to it.+ Powerful performance.  Without getting into too much technical information, the processor in this device (a rebranded Qualcomm Snapdragon 600) is significantly more powerful than the Nexus 7's Tegra 3 in every way.  It's also more power efficient, so you can watch your movies and games for longer, all while enjoying stunning looks.  Which brings me to the next two points...+ Beautiful screen.  This is a Full HD (1080p) panel in a 7\" package.  The best effort prior to this was Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD 8.9, which had a 1080p panel as well.  At present, this device has the sharpest screen (in terms of PPI) of any device, even compared against Apple's iPad 3 and Samsung's Nexus 10.  Colors are sharp and vivid and the screen has no motion blurring or ghosting.  My unit also doesn't have any light bleed, although I've seen some people complaining about it.+ Better hardware for longevity.  You may have heard of the recent kerfuffles around last year's Nexus 7, which has started to slow down and lag for many users.  The problem lay in how the device managed its onboard storage-- which, to put it mildly, was poor.  If you didn't mind tinkering and rooting your device, you could fix the issue, but that should never be a requirement in a consumer product.  Luckily enough, the refresh's hardware boasts better memory and Android 4.3 will automatically keep things in good shape, so you won't have to worry about this.+ Sound is pretty good for a small device.  It gets plenty loud without much distortion.  Unfortunately, ASUS elected to keep the speakers on the back for some unknown reason (especially with nice bezels on the top and bottom that could have provided stereo in landscape-- which is where you'd need those speakers most).  This is especially perplexing considering how well-reviewed the speakers on the Nexus 10 and HTC One were-- both packed front-facing stereo speakers.+ Android 4.3 under the hood means you've got a faster, more secure mobile experience than any previous version.  Even if you're primarily an iOS user, the Nexus 7 is definitely worth a look.  The Play Store's got almost all the heavy hitters you'd use on a tablet (such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix, a YouTube experience second to none, and the full power of Google's own services as an example), as well as some amazing Android-exclusive apps (such as Press, a beautiful RSS reader for those who prefer to take their news this way).  Many people have griped in the past about Android and tablet apps, but...+ You'll also find a mature and solid ecosystem waiting for you.  As a 7\" device, the refreshed Nexus 7 sits between traditional 10\"-class tablets and the smartphone, meaning it can use apps designed for either very well.  Although most Android apps are still designed for phones, they scale up very well on the Nexus 7 (nothing like Apple's frankly laughable 2x zoom mode available on the iPad/iPad Mini).  Android tablet apps are also getting better by the day, so unless there really is that one killer app you can't leave behind, give it a whirl!+ Android 4.3 also provides multiuser support, so if you have this tablet in any social settings (having friends over, throwing a party, and so on), you can easily set up a guest profile for friends to use while keeping your own stuff under lock and key.  It's also great as a family tablet-- share the device among multiple members while keeping everyone's stuff separate.  Things have also gotten a lot faster since the 4.2 days, so if you had any issues before, give it another go.+ Notification light!  Hoorah!  Long-time Android users will instantly recognize how useful these things are, and as a casual device to leave lying around your desk, the light makes things much better.  Let's say you're walking by a coffee table and you receive an e-mail.  With an iOS device, the screen will light up for a few seconds, and a pulsing icon will let you know that you've got a message of some sort.  And both iOS and Android handsets without a light (such as last year's Nexus 7) will beep or produce a tone to let you know the same.  But if you happen to walk by after those time out, you'd never know that you have something waiting for you.  With a notification light, you get a persistent, unobtrusive and instantly-visible way of seeing that something's waiting.+ Great battery life.  Although the battery's smaller than last year's Nexus 7 (probably to slim down the build), Android 4.3 and the newer Snapdragon processor make for quite a powerful (hehe) package that will run all day and then some without trouble.  I have yet to charge mine after receiving it two days back, and I'm still looking at 50% remaining after heavy use.Of course, this isn't all sunshine and daisies.  Make sure you're making an informed purchase.  Here are some cons I've noticed.CONS- The cameras are forgettable.  Good enough for video calling, but it won't even replace most smartphone cameras.- I'm having screen lift issues in the upper left hand-hand side of my tablet, which means the back creaks a little if I press on it.  It doesn't impact functionality at all, and hopefully it may go away after a while, but my launch-day 8GB Nexus 7 from last year also had this issue.  needless to say, I'm a little annoyed that they weren't more rigorous this time around.  Not something you should have to deal with as a consumer.- Top and bottom bezels make the device a little larger than it has to be.  Depending on how you use this device, it could actually be a major pro for you (as wider bezels give you a better surface to grip without accidentally touching the screen).  For me, it's a definite con, since I think it makes the device look a tad silly.- Slightly less grippy than last year's model.  The refresh loses the dimpled texture of the original, which makes it a little more \"slick\" in the hand.  It's not awful by any means, but do keep in mind that it can slide a little more on surface than you'd expect.- The buttons.  Are maddening.  They're basically flush with the chassis, and while there's solid feedback on all three (power, volume up, volume down), they're very close to one another and feel exactly the same.  Expect to hit volume up a lot trying to wake this device up.All in all, I'd say buy this one with confidence.  It's well worth the upgrade if you're on the fence, and if you're new to the Android tablet land, this is an amazing place to start.  As a Nexus device, it'll get long software support and fast upgrades, so you'll always be getting the latest and greatest.  Questions?

I have been using it since 4 days and everything seems to be working as expected.... I tested the touch screen using more than one test app and I found no issues.... also I didn't encounter any touch screen issues while using the device. I do have both android as well as Apple devices so I am not biased to anyone against the other... and to be honest, I was planning to buy the ipad mini with Retina display, but I didnt like its width and I HATED ITS PRICE !!!! so I bought this Nexus for less than half the price of the ipad mini (my 32G  Nexus 7 is $229 no Tax and no shipping while the 32G ipad mini is $550 including the Tax). I do believe that the ipad is more stable, more mature, looks nicer, and will out-perform this Nexus, but honestly for half the price I highly recommend this Nexus 7 .... I like this device: display is beautiful, performance is good (I updated to 4.4), and battery life is excellent.I am giving 4 starts because I believe that Asus should have done a little better job by reducing the huge top/bottom bezel or at least provide capacitive buttons and probably front speakers on this huge bezel in case if they decided to keep its size as is...I will update this review in case if I encounter any issues...."}, {"review_id": "f79a1a895567eef3f56027dd851d2f35", "review": "I really haven't found anything to dislike about this. It's a considerable improvement over the previous model year. It just does everything I expect of a tablet.The text is very clear and sharp.

This is my first tablet, although I have friends with iPads, iPad minis and the original Nexus 7, all of which I've used before.  To me, this device blows them all away and for the price you can't go wrong.I got the 16GB model because I'm not one of those people who stores a lot of content locally on the device.  I usually keep about 50 apps installed, some of them games, and there's plenty of storage for all of that.  The rest of my media is either streaming or stored in the cloud.  There's no microSD expansion, but honestly, I don't really miss it so far.  Cloud storage shared between your various devices is the future, and so far it's working well on this tablet as well as on my phone.The screen is straight up gorgeous, and content looks clean and crisp.  I'm running mine with auto-brightness and it seems to always pick a good happy medium between visibility and battery savings, so no complaints there.  Small text is easy to read and Netflix videos look great.  The dual speakers are loud enough, but they don't personally blow me away.  They do go to full volume without any noticeable distortion, however, so that's good.  If you're using this tablet for playing music you may be slightly disappointed, but for watching YouTube videos and movies they're perfectly acceptable.The battery life so far has been stellar.  Mine came out of the box yesterday with a 59% charge, and by the end of the night (about 7 hours later) with HEAVY use I was down to 19%.  The battery is technically smaller than the previous generation's battery, but this new chipset uses that power more efficiently and the device sips power in standby mode so this should last you 2 days on a charge unless you're constantly streaming full HD movies to it.  It does support wireless charging using the Qi standard, but I haven't tested that out yet although I fully plan on getting a wireless charging pad soon.Overall system performance has been nice and snappy.  It's my understanding they're using OpenGL for the system UI now, and all the animations and transitions feel much smoother than they ever have before.  Just swiping through and navigating around Android 4.3 feels great.  iOS may still be a bit smoother, but the difference to me is negligible after this most recent update to the Android OS.And my personal favorite feature is the name itself; This is a Nexus device and will come with all the developer goodies that I've come to love.  This is my 3rd Nexus device and I love how easy it is to flash custom software to it.  Within 20 minutes of getting this thing home yesterday I had unlocked the bootloader, flashed a custom recovery and backed up my current ROM before rooting it.  It's only a matter of days until we get custom ROMs coming out for it with cool features added in.  I'm personally looking forward to using the PIE controls and getting HALO running on it.If you're in the market for a tablet that's not too big to be portable, and that sits at a killer price point for the screen/performance that you get, the new Nexus 7 is a no-brainer."}, {"review_id": "8a4eca14d4a1f90a1964e33e24300263", "review": "I was a previous owner of the 2012 Nexus 7 which I loved at first but quickly became frustrated with due to performance issues.If you are thinking about upgrading the new 2013 Nexus 7 is almost better in every way.Things I like:- much better performance even in chrome (although maybe not perfect)- MUCH better screen. I honestly don't care whether it is high res or not but the old Nexus 7 had almost yellowish whites and uneven backlighting. This screen is 100% better.- another note about the screen. I was very worried that it wouldn't get dim enough for reading in the dark but it isn't any more troublesome than my old nexus 7 and it gets VERY bright for outside reading.- sound from the speakers seems better- I'm very happy to not have any of the main bugs (GPS and touch issues) that others are complaining about.Things that could be better:- the battery life while actually using the tablet isn't as good as the old Nexus 7. It isn't bad but I could use the battery up in a single day with a long web browsing session if I wanted to.- it is a little harder to hold - a combination of the back being less grippy and the side bezels (in portrait) being much smaller.- the screen can be overly sensitive at times. I don't think this is the same as the ghost touch bug because I've checked that the screen works properly with an app and I have no issues using swype. But I often accidentally click links or zoom in when web browsing- chrome still kind of sucks but that is chrome's problem.Overall I'm happy with my upgrade and I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone."}, {"review_id": "b98b1340db48e8c2f14d117efac6b934", "review": "I got one that was an \"open box\" item and the volume stopped working - the buttons and even settings wouldn't change the volume which had been set to the lowest setting (mute).  I tried turning off but then it didn't turn back on.  Took it back and it was replaced with a brand new one!Now I've had it for a while and have 3 accounts setup, one for myself, one for the wife and one restricted account for my 5 yr old.  The wife mainly watches videos (YouTube), son plays games and I play and surf.  Response is great although our internet connection is at tops 6Mbs so there are times when something that needs internet access may lag a bit.  I noticed one app that I play on my HTC One S always complains about the connection when I use the HTC phone, but on this tablet it just runs smoothly without every complaining - odd since they use the same WiFi connection.  The tablet response is good.The Android OS on this tablet is simple compared to my phone which has the HTC Sense version - not that the phone is \"hard\", but it may be why the phone seems a lot less responsive than this tablet.If you used any of the other OS (iOS, Win8, Firefox, etc...) then you will find the controls somewhat familiar.  Although there will be differences, they won't keep you from using the tablet.  You still have the apps you can download - some are free and some are paid apps.The volume control issue on the initial tablet seems to happen a bit as this one did the same, but I found out I could just change user accounts and it will work again - odd, but hopefully there will be an update that will prevent that from happening at all.Overall I am happy with the purchase and although there are a few things I wish it had (like expandable memory slot for a SD card for one, HDMI output for another), I think it's a great, fast and nice size for our first tablet.Update: Still have issue with \"mute\" getting stuck and having to swap accounts to get audio volume to function again.  But now also have an issue where the notification pull down bar (or whatever you want to call it) appears as we try to launch apps, swipe, or do anything.  We are having to power off and back on before it will work again.  Whatever they did with the latest release appears to have made the tablet worst than better and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.Update2: With the install of 4.4 KitKat, the screen problems appear to be gone now.  I haven't been using Mute a lot lately so not sure if that issue is also gone.Update3: And the problem is back!  Put a video on YouTube title Ematic vs Nexus 7.  The Ematic is a quad-core for $80 and in my opinion a better buy since it works (at least for now).  I'm going to see if Asus will take their paper weight back and give a refund.  This would be great if it worked correctly.Update4: Tablet's been with Asus for over two weeks.  RMA says waiting for customer confirmation \"swap\" so I called to find out what that meant and was told I will receive an email when Asus decides what to offer me.  Not a good experience at all.  You take a chance with these tablets that they will not work and you'll be stuck paying to send them back to Asus and wait for them to decide \"what to offer you\".Update4.1: May 30th received the replacement.  Asus sent a notice saying they shipped it and to check the \"courier\" site for updates but only listed \"TRUCKING\" as the courier with no tracking info.  On May 29th Fed Ex left a message saying they will be delivering a package that required a signature - that would have been hard to arrange if we were in a situation where no one would be home.  The item shipped from CA and not TX so I figured it must be a replacement unit and I was right as the serial # is different.  So far the replacement seems to be working."}, {"review_id": "52c9850f5f4f90c0f584e227373038d3", "review": "This is a review for Nexus 7 2013, 32 GB Wifi only model.

On the other hand this very same thing may not be so good for people with not so 20/20 vision.

I also own the original Airbender that I used with my iPad 2.  It was very good and I've been very happy with it, but I have to admit, this is a nice improvement.The overall look is much improved.  It is very clean and professional looking.  It is also somewhat ruggedized though I haven't tested the overall durability.  It is much lighter than the original keyboard and some of the competing keyboards that I checked out.  The weight is heavier than you might expect if you haven't used a keyboard before, but it is a nice complement to the iPad Air.  The overall design makes it very stable when using it on your lap.  The case is designed to allow you to rotate the iPad from landscape to portrait.  This is very convenient and also allows you to choose which direction you like the iPad's buttons to be on.The keyboard itself is surprisingly easy to type on. They keys are normal size and have normal spacing.  I can type on this keyboard as easily as I can my desktop keyboard.  The keys have good feedback.  There are also dedicated iOS keys for home and lock.  Additionally there are the extra keys necessary to work with OSX and Windows.The keyboard connects via Bluetooth.  It is very simple to pair it with the iPad.  While designed for iPad, it also works with iPhones and computers.The keyboard charges via micro-usb.  It does not take long to charge and the battery lasts a very long time.The new Airbender 2.0 also has a nice new design that allows the iPad stand to be removed from the keyboard and stand alone.  This allows you to set it up similar to a separate keyboard and monitor like you would have with your computer.  This feature actually works very well on a solid surface.Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the improvements in this keyboard.

It is a very sturdy, elegant and functional Bluetooth keyboard case for your iPad Air. It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Air in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it&#8217;s pretty heavy, although not as heavy as the original version of Airbender. The case has been obviously redesigned, and it has lost some of its bulk. The new case doesn&#8217;t come with the several layers of protection for the iPad, which made it fairly hard to put your iPad in and out.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Air almost completely, except for the screen, which is now completely exposed. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Air from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use. The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is cramped, and it will really vary from one individual to the next how comfortable you find typing on a keyboard of this size. I am fine with composing emails and typing documents that are up to 500 words in length (such as this one), but I would not consider writing the next great American novel on it.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. The design of the arm and its attachment mechanism has also been tweaked from the previous model, and it&#8217;s now much easier to adjust it and keep the iPad fixed in its place. Both the landscape and the portrait modes are fully supported. The arm is detachable, and it allows you to position the keyboard at some distance from the iPad while typing &#8211; very convenient for the times when you don&#8217;t want to stare too closely at the small screen. When attached the are is very securely fixed and it allows you for the &#8220;true&#8221; laptop use anywhere where you feel like taking your iPad Air.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model. I highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "8436b60cbd9efd60312929692144acea", "review": "I travel frequently for business and have been seeking a Bluetooth keyboard case for my iPad Air so that I do not have to bring my laptop everywhere.

Straight out of the box you could tell that this was a quality item! Unlike competing products, this case has a very solid hinge that holds your iPad Air at any angle you choose. Additionally, you can alter the height which no other product offers.The keyboard connected seamlessly to my iPad and worked flawlessly during a 2 hour typing session.The case of this keyboard is tough and will absolutely protect my iPad.I have no reservations about protecting my iPad with this case.Overall, this item far exceeded my expectations!

I find myself using the volume controls a lot - much better than finding the right side of the iPad with the controls and hitting the wrong one by mistake!  I am typing this review on the keyboard and it is working really well.  I havee also used the keyyboard forr several hours and have not neeededd to charge it once yet.Case/StandThe case overall is very sturdy.  It has a nice solid, slightly heavy feel to it.  I assume the weight is due to the battery.  The case closes tightly and has a nice latch to keep it closed.  Another positive with the case is that it is very configurable.  There are a lot of different orientations that you can place the iPad in (portrait, landscape, folded over on top of the keyboard).  There is a groove at the top of the keyboard for resting the iPad in so it doesn't move when you touch it.  Unfortunately, I have found it slightly awkward to get the iPad in the groove because it requires sliding a latch on the back of the keyboard and pulling the stand part of the case sligtly out of the keyboard.My favorite way to use the case is on a table.  I pull the iPad and stand completely out of the keyboard and place it several inches behind the keyboard.  It makes it very easy to sit down and knock out some emails withough having to use the on-screen keyboard.  It is very handy to be able to remove the iPad but keep the stand attached, without needing the keyboard.  I have used it several times this way as well.The case also has the ability to detach the iPad from the keyboard and stand entirely.  It is very quick and easy to remove it by using a camera lens cap type of connector.  The iPad itself sits in a thin plastic case that wraps around the sides and back of the iPad.  it's not incredibly protective and I'm not sure how it would handle a drop, but it's much better than no case and does offer scratch protection for the back of the iPad.OverallThis case works well as a case for a family iPad.  It can be used with the keyboard for doing text-intensive work, then with just the stand for watching videos or playing games.  It's also quick to pop off of both to hand it to the kids to use, while still offering some protection.  The keyboard feels and works great and the case is solid and very adjustable, with just a few small quirks"}], "B00F3KWZW8": [{"review_id": "39cdff67b6d5eccc1c83388a036e0712", "review": "This is my first time installing an ip camera. I good at computers but networking is probably my weak point. This camera was fairly easy to set up for monitoring within your on LAN. Even then it had some minor quirks. The biggest challenge for me was installing this on my cell phone. The user manual is detailed by fairly useless. Unless you know about port forwarding and ddns getting it to show on your cell phone outside of you LAN will stump you. My first try I thought wow this was easy. Within no time I got it to work on my phone at home. The I went out and realized it ain't working. I didn't know enough about networking to know why or what was the problem. Tech support was helpful and finally got me going but that involved them taking remote control of my computer and did whatever they had to do to get me going. I am up and running now but if I had to install this again, I wouldn't what tech support did to my system to duplicate. So the question is what if I buy another FOSCAM camera?The camera works well and appears to be high quality. The 760 HD video is sharp and clear and the IR works well at night. The IR does cast a reddish glow and the network light in the back does blink so don't install this in a place where that would bother you at night."}], "B00F3SOHNU": [{"review_id": "d66f588b8594d9c06bb03868fa067bb3", "review": "I purchased this tablet as a refurb through Woot.  The first one I received had a bad dent in the top of the tablet right on the top of the volume rocker.  Woot agreed to replace it.  The second one I received was in \"like new\" condition.  Overall I reallly like this tablet.  Since updating it with the new KitKat OS the tablet is very responsive and I don't experience any lags that other people reported.  I did start having video problems with certain feeds with the new OS.  I would get a choppy, distorted image and bad pixelation. I found that by forcing all video to be rendered by the GPU, (by enabling the develooper options) solved this problem. Samsung has a bug somewhere and needs to fix this with an update.  I also wish Android and Adobe would sort out the Flash video fiasco.  Please kill this dead technology and get everyone on to HTML 5.  Instead Adobe keeps pushing it which makes life miserable for everyone on Android and Apple devices.  Developers need to be mandated to get off of the FLASH content as the industry has agreed to move to HTML5.  Yes, I know, you can still use Flash on this device, but it is a PITA to implement.One thing that is very nice is that you can work with two applications on a split screen at the same time on this tablet.  The downside is that you can only do this with select applications.  Samsung used to have a little tab on the left of the screen to pull the eligible apps out to choose for split screen work.  Once KitKat came out it is now on the right hand side of the screen with no visible tab.  What I don't like about this is you have applications that you swipe content from right to left and you end up pulling this tab out by accident. (Very annoying)  They should have left it where it was.  Samsung has media apps that flip pages from right to left - so putting the split screen applications on the right hand side of the screen makes no sense.  Samsung are you listining?The screen image is nice.  It is not \"Blow me away\" nice - but the resolution is very good.  The colors are very accurate for viewing pictures and watching movies.  It does not use a super Amoled screen and in my opinion other screens look better even though this tablet has higher resolution.  Why Samsung didn't use a super Amoled screen on this expenisve device is questionable.  The screen is very bright and most of the time I have the brightness at 50% or less.The part I thought I would like the best was the S-Pen.  Unfortunatelly, to me this is still awkard to use.  The only pen that works acurately with this tablet is the one that you get with the tablet.  I can't stand writing with this very thin writing instrument.  Samsung also doesn't give you any replacement nibs for it and it is almost impossible to find them anywhere.  I tried multiple other thicker OEM pens including Samsungs own S-pen with eraser for Galaxy note tablets, but all of them have a noticeable offset when writing which makes them unuseable for any fine writing work.  Why a vendor can't make a useable aftermarket pen for this device is a mystery to me.  I e-mailed Wacom, (who apparently makes the pens for Samsung) but they never responded back to me.  I wanted to buy their Bamboo \"Feel\" pen, as it was wider, but too many reviews said it also had this offset issue.  I guess I won't be buying their pen either.  So - if you want this for the writing capability, plan on using the very thin pen that comes with it and when the nib wears out, having to purchase another new pen.  In fact, I'd buy a second one now unless you can find the replacement nibs.  Apparently you can purchase them from Samsung directly, but I spent an hour on a chat line with Samsung service and got no where with them.  If they do have them, I'll bet it is cheaper to buy a whole new pen.Writing on the tablet is NOT like writing with paper and pen.  I don't care what anyone says,  In my opinion it is awkward at best and I have been practicing for quite some time.  Lecture Notes is the best app available for taking notes on this device but it is difficult to configure and set up.  Once you figure it out, it does give you some good functionality.  It also allows you to record lectures with audio and write notes at the same time.  Samsung has their own apps for taking notes but they could be integrated better and in my opinion, are not as good as the Lecture Notes application.  Hopefully Samsung will keep improving their applications for note taking.Battery life is acceptable but not great.  I usually get 1 day of use out of it with heavy use.  I simply charge it over night so I really don't care how long it takes to charge.  It has a very big baterry in it to feed a very powerfull processor so it is going to take a while to charge it back up.  I also hate not being able to replace the battery in these devices.  You actually can - but you have to watch some Youtube videos and do some minor surgery to accomplish this.  I figure by the time the battery wears out I'll probably want something newer anyway.I do like the media integration that Samsung put on this tablet.  The flip up from bottom of the screen function to receive your news, social media, etc. is very nice. Samsung also has a magazine/news application included which is very nice and well integrated into the tablet. They also include a free trial to Zinio for subscribing to magazines.  I'm sorry, but a 10 inch tablet is just not a good reading experience for magazines.  I find I constantlly have to zoom into the text to read them.I actually like the Samsung integrated application launcher and think they did a nice job of making the Android experience better.  Don't expect to get much help with learning this tablet.  I found the information on how to use it is scattered all over the internet.  Most of what I learned, I learned from other reviewers of the tablet.The tablet is quite expensive.  I saved about a hundred bucks buying it refurbished, but it still is more expensive than most tablets. However, when you consider the hardware this has I think it is worth it.  First you get two sets of quad core processors.  One set is for high power use and the other one is to save battery life when using applications that don't need the processing speed.  You get a six core video processor.  You get 3GB's of internal System RAM and 32GB of internal RAM.  I also applaud Samsung for letting you use an external micro SD card.  I have a 64GB card in mine and now 128GB micro cards are coming on the market.  This will certainly give this tablet longevity, allowing me to use it for years.The build quality of the tablet is average.  It's not bad, (don't get me wrong) its just not great.  They make a big deal about the stiched leather look on the back, but it is just plain old plastic.  So why bother?  Nothing about the tablet exudes quality to me.  For the price, Samsung should have included a case for it and made the actual unit out of metal alloy.  I purchased the Roo leather case which has been great.  It comes with a very protective leather cover that you can zip the tablet into and has a nice leather wrap around the tablet itself.  I wanted something that protected the tablet in case I dropped it.  In my opinion, this is the best case for the money as it is all leather.Overall I'm very happy with this tablet.  Yes, there are some minor issues with it and I still don't think the S-pen is everything it is cracked up to be.  I hope Samsung keeps improving it and comes up with better S-pen functionality.I would highly recommend this tablet, but would encourage you to look for discounts as Samsung has just announced that it will be replacing these with newer models this summer. (Including super amoled displays)  Plan on paying a premium for these newer models.In summary:Pros:Very responsive and powerful Tablet (Two sets of quad core processors- six core video)3GB of internal System RAMHigh Screen resolution - (best in class)Accurate screen colors - very bright screenSamsung's app launcher is nicely integrated to make the user experience better than stock Android in my opinion.32GB of internal RAM, can use an external micro SDHC card adding 64GB of user RAM (128GB coming)Can run two applications at once on the same screen (No other tablet can do this today)(However, apps that can do this are limited and you have to swipe from right to left to do it which inteferes with other apps) Even so - being able to have both your e-mail and browser up at the same time is nice. (Even two browser windows at the same time!Needs improvement:Quality and feel of tablet is mediocre and feels cheap for the money you pay.  (Back plastic stiching is cheesy and doesn't fool anyone)S-Pen needs improvement.  Biggest complaint is no other S-pen can be used with an offset issue - pen is too thin.Battery is adequate but could be better.  Plan on getting a full day out of it max in heavy use.  (Charge time is slow)No super Amoled screen.  Screen is very good - but not as good as Amoled screens on other devices with less resolution.Expect a long learning curve with information scattered all over the web.Expensive - Look for a refurbished or discounts to lower the price - otherwise wait for the new models to come outSamsungs customer support is not the best but is on par with everyone's lousy customer service these days.There is no perfect tablet on the market today.  The issues I raised are minor and overall, I still think this is one of the best tablets you can buy today.  If you can find a discount on this tablet, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.  I still think it is the best overall tablet you can buy at this time."}, {"review_id": "3e1f70be2657c0d25eb82b488fbdf711", "review": "Awesome tablet. I had an ASUS Prime tf201 with keyboard so i wanted to ugrade to something really fast. The Note is really nice. I like the speakers and volume (much improved from the asus). The lower home button is not so ideal, and you dont see in the dark the back button, after you press it there will be light on it. Feels like there is too much stuff running in the background. All apps closed and still more than one GB of ram are in use. Luckily this has 3GB. Screen resolution is great but so far i have not experienced yet a true hd movie with netflix or youtube. Battery time is good but mostly drained by the screen, so i keep it to lower brightness. I wish power cord connection was not on the bottom. This is bad if you want to have tablet stand up with folding case, while charging. Impossible. But the trick is, rotate it 180degrees... But then the folding case will not stand."}, {"review_id": "8965be6ee910cd1ab3bd1ca1b879168f", "review": "I am laughing when I hear people say iPad is helping their productivity. Regardless whether you like Android or not, Samsung has managed to create a BEAUTIFUL device, that is extremely helpful.

I made a lot of iPad users Samsung envy... Well, this is not a toy, it's a tool!The screen is fantastically bright and the system is amazingly fast.

To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates \"templates,\" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]\"Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app.\"These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the \"pleather\" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol"}], "B00FEE7B1I": [{"review_id": "f334c26b183b29d63901f99527fd5cbc", "review": "I was shopping around for a Windows based tablet for the past 6 months.  Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility."}, {"review_id": "7c971b6ee956bef3b7faa4dd88575f0c", "review": "I've been running the Dell Venue Pro 8 daily for about a week now so I'll give you my brain dump.The form factor really appeals to me. Super light, almost pocketable size makes it really easy to just pick up and go anywhere with it. 10&#34; tablets always make me think (albeit only briefly) about were I'm going to stash it.Battery life has been pretty much right on the &#34;all day&#34; claim, assuming that you stop to eat every few hours and aren't playing online games and pooping in a diaper. I can surf the web essentially all day, at least as much as I can stand.Screen is good, but I've seen way better IPS panels than this one. Brightness is good when you disable the auto-management function. People who bitch that the resolution is too low have NO idea what they're talking about. The screen is only 8 inches! Any higher resolution and you'll need a magnifying glass to see the menus. Seriously. This is Windows, not Android and it handles DPI differently.Performance is impressive considering there's no active cooling at all on this. The combination of quad-cores and SSD makes everything very snappy. The processor benchmarks similarly to a Core2Duo and just under some of the slower Core i3 chips. Processor heavy apps won't be impressed (haven't tried Photoshop or anything like that) but everything else runs smoothly.Really does cold boot in seconds and resumes from sleep instantly.Single micro USB port can't simultaneously charge the device and run USB peripherals without a little trickery. That said I've seen video of it running quad external displays with a keyboard and mouse all through the one USB port no problem. If you're really determined you could run it as a dockable desktop. I got a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for mine to eliminate that concern.Windows 8.1. I don't use Metro apps much, they either don't have what I need or suck 80% of the time. I set mine to boot to desktop. Having said that the Metro apps that don't suck are GREAT. Netflix, Adobe, Amazon, and a few random games rock.Built-in Office 2013 works well with touch and you can tell they put some thought into it.Bottom line: Good performance and the most portable full Windows experience money can buy.

I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.I had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.Here are my findings:GOOD:- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2\" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.- The speakers are better than my 17\" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.BAD:- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.OTHER THOUGHTS:- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.IN SUM:For me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.All in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.  For the price, there are better laptops and there are better tablets, but as a low-priced combo, it's a grand slam."}, {"review_id": "01d6fe004f6ba28bdca7b6e819bce7df", "review": "The ASUS Transformer Book T100 delivers a ton of value in a mostly compelling package. The beauty of today's computing devices is that consumers are no longer forced to buy one-size-fits-all, and instead, have the choice to buy what best fits their needs. I've used the ASUS T100 (64GB) over the past couple of days, and while I wouldn't consider it powerful/comfortable enough as primary computing device, I think it makes great sense as a secondary machine, especially with the advances in cloud storage.From my perspective, the ASUS T100 is basically a tablet with the ability to become a mini-notebook. Whether you will love or hate it strongly depends on what your intended application and expectations are. I plan to use the ASUS T100 for both work and recreation, with note-taking, email, web browsing, presenting, and video playback being the most common tasks, and from my initial impression, it does these jobs quite well. While I found the keyboard a bit too cramped for my liking (smaller-than-normal keys + tighter spacing + my big hands = not very happy), and wasn't too keen on the touch/clickpad (doesn't always respond to the first touch, two-finger scrolling can be a bit jerky, loud and hollow-sounding click), it wasn't a deal-breaker considering the price point. The keyboard dock is really usable, and I appreciated having it when I was typing longer emails and editing office documents.The ASUS T100 features a Intel Atom Z3740 Quad-Core processor which is exceptionally power efficient and much better performing than previous Atoms, though it is still slow compared to traditional notebook/ultrabook processors. For example, the year-old \"low-end\" Pentium 2117U, rated at 17W TDP, is more than twice as fast as the Atom Z3470 in single-threaded workloads though it can also draw ~4X more power. The Z3740 is pretty even with the Pentium in multi-threaded workloads, through the slower single-threaded performance will be more evident with slower app/program launches, etc.At the end of the day, I like the ASUS T100. ASUS has developed many 2-in-1 transforming solutions in the past and its expertise shows in the T100 ~ while made of the plastic, the overall build quality and precision is good for the price. I more or less agree with the specifications such as as the CPU and 64GB of eMMC, though I think 2GB of RAM is too stingy, especially since it cannot be upgraded later. Overall, I think the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is a much needed breath of fresh air and I'm excited about the future possibilities.Notes:1) Compared to the ARM versions of Microsoft's Surface RT and upcoming Surface 2 (non-pro), the ASUS T100 offers an exceptional value proposition by bundling Office 2013 and being compatible with regular Windows software.2) For my own computing needs, I found the combination of a portable machine with good battery life, paired with a powerful desktop to be ideal. The \"good-enough\" performance of the ASUS T100 along with great battery life and ability to fall back to full-blown Windows makes it well suited for this role.3) Web Browsing and Document editing on Microsoft platforms is generally a great experience. Internet Explorer on both Modern and Desktop modes is fully functional and delivers a rich web experience with Flash, Javascript, HTML5, etc. Office 2013 allows for native viewing and editing of documents which is something iOS and Android sometimes have difficulty with.4) Office 2013 Home and Student is pre-installed and includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note. A serial number for activation is in the box.5) The charging cable is Micro USB but is very short by laptop standards. It attaches to the tablet side instead of the keyboard dock. The USB port on the keyboard dock is on the LEFT side.6) The Windows 8.1 UI feels very fluid though App/Program launches can be sluggish.7) Free space on the 64GB version is ~ 37GB. Windows 8 has a built-in recovery mechanism which allows you to re-install/repair Windows or remove all user files.8) The T100 supports Microsoft's Connected Standby feature which means it only sips power in the suspend state so you don't need to turn it on/off frequently. Modern Apps such as email are refreshed periodically even in suspend so the live tiles are \"fresh\" when you resume the system. Resume from suspend is nearly instantaneous. It should be noted that desktop apps are suspended during Connected Standby so they are not refreshed.9) Boot times are quick ~ the system can boot to the start screen in &lt;10 seconds.10) A full-sized USB port on the tablet would have been highly appreciated...Hopefully a future version will have multiple USB ports!11) Slightly Annoying: The Windows button on the front/bottom of the tablet doesn't do anything! The only way to get back to the Start screen from the desktop is either to hit the Start Button or use the charms.12) Battery life is really quite good. I haven't run it down from 100% to zero but 8 hours of light use is very doable."}], "B00G4UQ6U8": [{"review_id": "b4b54e67b3b3ac2f8f7354476534da74", "review": "I have been extremely pleased with Brainwavz S1 headphones. I have not been very impressed with any of the in-ear headphones I have tried in the past due to lack of comfort and poor sound quality. Brainwavzs has a developed a product that has addressed these areas and offers more.Firstly, the ear buds fit comfortably and don't tug on the ears. After an hour of wearing these headphones, my ears still feel fine.  The company includes several different options for inner ear tips. It is trial and error to find the ones that work for you. Secondly, the sound quality is great for my uses. I tried these on an airplane to watch a movie and during a work out to listen to music. As advertised, the bass and vocals were clear and not overbearing. Though they didn't cancel sound as the bulkier headphones do, but the sounds quality was impressive while on the airplane. To note, I did not try any tips other than the tri-flange tips during the plane trip. Additionally, when the outside of the earbuds are rubbed or brush against something during sound play, the sound is not impacted.Some added features that add to this product are the flat wires that cut back on tangling. This seems to work well. They did not require any untangling when getting them out for use. The hard earphone carrying case is great and small.Overall, this is an excellent product. They offer excellent sounds quality in a compact size and an affordable price.

This case does not add extra bulk, unlike other cases on the market, which is a plus for everyday people who travel to and from work daily and don't want to be burdened with a heavy case. The case is very sleek but will still provide more than enough protection for your daily needs. I have brought this back and forth from my house to my office ,transporting it in a briefcase and there have been no scratches or dents on my Ipad mini. The second feature I like about this case is the ease of installing it onto the Ipad mini and being able to take it off just as easily. There have been other cases in the past that were not so easy to take on and off and I ended up damaging the case and chipping the side of my ipad. The Bluetooth was more than easy to set up (directions in instruction manual) andvery responsive. The best part of this case in my opinion is the keyboard, as the layout of the keys are perfect to actually get work done and are not just there for decoration. Lastly is the way you are able to rotate the case a full 360 degrees and change the angle up to 180 degrees. This feature came in handy when I needed to show diagrams and displays to upper level management in a meeting. It looks like New Trent has done their homework in figuring out the perfect case consumers expect in this kind of market. All in all I would rate this Ipad case a 4.5 out of 5 stars as it has easily covered all of my needs and some, whether they were personal or work related. The only flaw I have is there is no protection for the screen of the Ipad, but that can be easily fixed with a screen protector. If you are looking for a fully functional and sleek case to compliment and make your Ipad life easier, buy this and you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "71d431154858d007f0c35275a68f3a7e", "review": "My Logitech keyboard / case recently broke and I thought I&#8217;d give something else a try. I ended up getting the Airbender (since it&#8217;s half the price and has a really slim profile). I slipped the iPad mini right into the holder and it melds into the case. It looks like it was always meant to be there. A perfect fit!It makes the iPad mini look like a macbook pro clam shell laptop with very thin profile. I do a lot of typing and this is a great product. It is responsive and works very well. The coolest feature on this case is the swivel top design. It allows me to turn it into a tablet when I do not need the keyboard. The only thing that I have not yet been able to test is the longevity of the battery. But I&#8217;m sure that it should last forever on one charge. With the LED indicator, I know if there is a charge or not, unlike the logitech.There is only one thing I would modify on this keyboard case. I would make the rubberized paint a bit more sticky. In the cold it gets a bit slippery when you wear gloves.The only difference between the the Logitech and Airbender is the slight weight difference.

I like that so much better than the single slide out piece on the NT 30 that my iPad mini case has. I find the iPad is much more stable when separated from the keyboard. Another handy feature is the little ledges that hold the iPad Air in place at the back of the keyboard when the stand is in the open position.I also really like the full size keys on the keyboard and find it to be very responsive and warms up very quickly.I wish that some kind of screen protection was included but it's easy enough to obtain a screen protector film to protect from scratches.Other than the need for screen protection, I can't really find anything about this case that I don't like."}, {"review_id": "be16b644251eda4baaa4bcafb8e2bc8f", "review": "The New Trent Airbender Air Clamshell Bluetooth keyboard case for the iPad Air is an improvement over  many of the older models for previous iPads. The keyboard continues to be easy to use even in big hands. One complaint I had with my old keyboard was a lack of cut, copy paste functions. Well now I have them and they work well for my purposes. Also included are function keys for brightness, volume, music/video play options, and home screen or locking the screen. They all work well and make navigating easier.The case itself has a nice look and feel to it. The case doesn't feel cheap or too plasticky. As the name suggests its a clamshell design, that remains as one unit, with a swivel arm that allows for you to display the iPad in either landscape or portrait positions. The arm has a nice strong feel to it, since it is made of metal rather than plastic. The arm could use a lock that keeps the iPad at the user's perfect pitch, but the pitch at the fully extended position feels fine to me.Easy bluetooth connection, and great battery life make this a great keyboard. I have had for about 10 days now and have yet to plug in for my first charge. One feature I am happy to see is the bottom of the case doesn't prohibit you from being able to utilize the lightning adapter for old 30 pin products. I happen to have one of these and use it for charging while traveling.Overall I like this keyboard, but I have had the opportunity to also use New Trent Airbender 2.0 for the iPad air as well. While I do like the look and feel of this version, I am much happier using the Airbender 2.0 due to the ability to detach the back of the case from the keyboard itself. If you are someone who mostly uses their iPad with a bluetooth keyboard often, this may be the way to go, otherwise if you are like me and want a functional keyboard at times, with the ability to leave it at home and still have a case for your iPad, think about the Airbender 2.0."}, {"review_id": "7a0136d924fa5eab05b4d2df59aea1f4", "review": "Case works perfectly, keyboard feels great and the hotkeys are amazing! I was going to buy another case for 100 dollars at BB, but found this one on Amazon, and I am so happy I bought this one.One thing I do wish it had was magnets on the two bottom resting metals that hold the ipad when it is standing in landscape or portrait, cause if you accidentally tilt the ipad to much backwards, then the ipad has no locking mechanism to stay put and may fall backwards. This is really not a deal breaker for me cause i already know its like that so Im just more careful. Only problem maybe when someone that doesnt know about it, may pickup my ipad and not realize it and it may fall backwards. So a magnetic strong enough force to keep it standing would be an awesome upgrade.Overall, I am so happy.

I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s. These may not be the greatest pictures, but it will provide you with some sense of this great case.

It's an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The Airbender Pro has a thick and very protective rubber case that protects the iPad Air and the bluetooth keyboard.  It's somewhat thick, which helps to make it extra protective.  It protects all the ports and has a built in screen protector.  It also has holes for the speakers so you can still listen to music.  The case is shock and water resistant.  It is not water proof.  It would be really great to have a waterproof case.  If I am outside in the snow or rain and want to use my iPad, it would be nice to have it in a waterproof case.  The bluetooth keyboard is a full keyboard.  It pairs easily with the iPad Air.  It's very easy to type on.  The keys are comfortable.  It could use a mouse.  If the keyboard was rearranged, and the keys were moved up, there would be room for a laptop style mouse or a pencil eraser style mouse.  The way in which the port coverings attached to the case seem somewhat flimsy, like they could fall off after a few months of everyday use.  The keyboard has an internal battery and can be charged using a micro USB.  The battery will last all day long.  I use this case and keyboard everyday, both at home and at work.  I perform Human Resources and Payroll functions at my job.  I do a lot of work on the Internet and send and receive a plethora of email throughout the day.  This case would be great for anyone in any occupation that needs a bluetooth keyboard for their iPad Air and a protective case.  This case really turns the iPad Air into a mini laptop.  I have gotten several really nice compliments from co-workers about how attractive the case is and how useful it is.  This case has a really rugged metal arm that won't break like the plastic arms that some of the cases have.  With this protective case on my iPad Air, I feel that I can take it more places.  It's also more usable with the keyboard.  Sometimes the bluetooth keyboard does make my iPad freeze up when I check my email on Microsoft Exchange.  Other than that the keyboard has been great.  Sometimes if I let the iPad sit for awhile, it will lose its connectivity to the bluetooth keyboard and I have to reconnect.  I give this case and keyboard a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  This is definitely an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The case on the Airbender 2.0 was thin and flimsy.  The Airbender Pro is awesome, durable, and rugged.

This is my second tablet and I compare a lot of my expectations for a tablet to the Vizio tablet which I loved and never had a problem with, but wanted more memory than 4GB.First off, the Lenovo K1 has a nice big/bright display. I have watched a few Amazon instant videos and YouTube clips and they look great. The speakers are small but don't sound too bad, but this is no Bose system either. The K1 comes with a ton of apps and some are the full/pay versions such as Documents to Go. I have deleted some of the preloaded apps and have used the included Android market and Lenovo market to download other apps as well as the Amazon app market. The K1 also has GPS built in and has the Google navigation app that is pretty cool, but I will probably still use my Garmin due to it being smaller for use in my car. The K1 doesn't weigh too much and is not too bulky either. The performance is pretty fast and I have had no lags of opening or closing apps.Before I bought the Lenovo K1 I did a lot of research and saw many mixed reviews. After unboxing my K1, I updated the software to the latest version and then performed a factory reset. My K1 works perfectly and I do not have the crashing, forced closure of apps, of system freezes that many have complained about and wonder if they updated to the 829 software build(latest version as of now)and performed a factory reset if that might fix their problems.My suggestion is to go to a brick and mortar store such as Office Depot and try the Lenovo K1 out for yourself. If you like it, buy it from Amazon and save yourself some money aswell as the tax and you also get free shipping. With the money saved, you can buy a nice case to put your k1 in.*** July 2012 Update.***While my K1 has been pretty much trouble free, I can no longer recommend the K1 or any other Lenovo product. Lenovo's support of its product is pretty poor. Lenovo has an accessory called a USB host cable that makes it possible to hook up USB objects to the K1. The USB host cable was included with the K1 in Europe and other overseas locations but not in the US, when enough people complained, Lenovo received a small amount and took over a month to distribute what they had. Most owners missed out as you had only about 48 hours to order this cable and the only notification that lenovo was going to sell this cable was on a forum on thier website. Lenov also promised owners of the K1 an update to the newest version of the android software 4.0, so far Lenovo has not deliverd and the release date keeps slipping and may never arrive.Due to these problems, I NO LONGER RECOMMEND LENOVO products."}], "B00005LEN4": [{"review_id": "3c1f26f3a126eb3c35086e374d9ebb92", "review": "UPDATED: 5/20/2011:  I used my D700, and only my 50mm F1.8 to capture my Grandson's first haircut!  I posted an image here.  And, on the way home following the haircut, a clearing storm brought some gorgeous bluish-black clouds at dusk so I swung down towards the river and shot a couple of shots with the 50mm.  I posted one here called \"Blue Hour\".  Enjoy.  Seriously, can't go wrong -- though the price seems to be creeping upwards...This 50mm 1.8 is an excellent purchase at around a hundred bucks.  I hate to use the word investment, because we know camera equipment is definitely NOT an investment.  I bought it because I heard so much about it, and, I had a 50mm back in my old film days.  I have not  been disappointed.  I will agree with  many here who say that at F1.8 the results are less than stellar.  This is true--- there is a lack of contrast, not necessarily sharpness (at least in my copy of the lens) that you will notice.  Since I know that as a fact going in to a shoot or session, I set my aperture at F2.0, or F2.2 on my D700, or D300.  This solves the problem.  The resulting images at F 2.0 and above are amazingly sharp, and clear.  Don't get me wrong, I love my 16-35F4VR, and my 24-70F2.8 but this 50mm rocks as a standalone lens when the situation demands fast lens.  As a matter of fact, in a few hours I'm heading off to my grandsons first haircut of his life.  What did I pack?  The D700 (for better high ISO performance than the D300), and my 50mm 1.8.For the price (which seems to have risen lately and rightly so) you can't go wrong.  Even if you have other zoom lenses that cover this range as I do, this lens is unbelievably useful in low light to no light situations.  Personally, I'm lazy and hate zooming with my feet, but I'd much rather do that with this lens, than either using flash, or blurring photos of important events.The lens finish is plasticy but so what?  Are you going to be banging it around on a regular basis?  My 50mm travels with me just about everywhere either in a camera bag, or in my North Face Recon backpack (not a camera backpack) just about everywhere, and I pump about 80,000 images a year per body, between landscapes, motorsports, portraits, etc.  So far, so good.  It does stand up to a beating.  I do not use any protective filter on it as the glass is relatively well recessed on this lens.When I do need to use filters such as polarizers, or ND's, I have step-up rings that take the lens from the 52mm size to 77mm which is the standard size of all my filters. It does look \"strange\" having the tiny little 50mm lens hidden behind a huge 77mm filter, but it WORKS.Again, if you are looking to make an investment -- there's that ugly word again, make that acquisition, to your photo gear you can't go wrong at this price point; If you wind up hating it, there's always the ability to return it, or sell it on eBay.Enjoy."}], "B00006I53S": [{"review_id": "fac2e8bec06035a70307dd1e8034ea63", "review": "I bought this lens for my Canon 20D digital camera and have found it to be a great all-purpose, everyday-use lens.  Here are the best features from my perspective:1.  The range of telephoto zoom is adequate for 90% of photo opportunites.  28-135 mm telephoto in digital photography translates into 48-230 mm in SLR film photography.  Since a standard camera lens is 50-55 mm, the starting range of this zoom lens equals that and then has the added versatility of zooming up to 135 mm (or 230mm in old style camera figures).  In my opinion, this added range of framing a shot gives the photographer so much more creativity, as well as being able to bring objects into closer, more intimate range.  I mentioned that this lens is good for 90% of all general camera shots; the missing 10% are those pictures that require a better zoom (more telephoto zoom), and those pics that need a wider field of view.  You may find that for group photos in close proximity, you want to take a step backwards to get everybody in the frame.  This is not a problem unless you simply don't have the room to take that step back.  I solved this problem by switching back to the original 18-55mm lens that came with the camera.  For the more distant shots that can't be drawn into the 135mm zoom of this lens I purchased a better telephoto zoom.2.  The lens has autofocus and IS stabilization technology.  For one used to manual focus lenses in SLR film photography, the addition of a fast autofocus lens is a terrific feature! I used to miss those spur of the moment shots because I was trying to achieve focus.  With this lens, you make those shots, because within a milisecond of depressing the shutter down halfway, the picture snaps into focus!  I absolutely love this feature!  The focuser has many points of potential focus, so it adapts easily to virtually all focusing situations.  For the really difficult focusing shots, there is the option of manual focusing.  While nice to have, I rarely use this option.  The Image Stabilization feature is a handy one in the longer shots.  \"IS\" lets one get away with a bit of camera shake without too much out-of-focus smear on the picture.  Canon does not recommend using the IS feature on tripod shots, so there is a switch to turn off the IS if desired.3.  The lens takes sharp clear pictures.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of the lens at all.Drawbacks1.  While there are not too many drawbacks to this lens, I think the major one is that the lens is bigger and heavier, in fact, much bigger and heavier than the standard 17-55 mm lenses that come with SLR cameras.  For me this is not a problem, however, for one that wants to have a lighter-weight camera, this could be considered a serious drawback.  On the other hand, a SLR camera like the Canon 20D or digital Rebel is not designed to be a smaller pocket-sized camera.  It is a larger format camera and of course the lenses will be larger (and heavier) as well.2.  Cost.  At just over 400 dollars, this lens is an investment.  Again, one has to weigh the obvious financial outlay, but the 28-135 mm lens is so superior to the cheaper 18-55 mm lens, that in my opinion, it is well worth the cost to upgrade.With this product, Canon made a great everyday camera lens.  From my perspective, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and I do recommend this lens to be your everyday standard camera lens.Jim \"Konedog\" Koenig"}, {"review_id": "26bf35fe7f9a73d28535d5072ab17714", "review": "I am not a professional or expert photographer...so take these comments with this in mind.I have two Canon cameras, a 40D and a 60D.  I have two other Canon IS USM lenses, a 17-55 f2.8 and a 70-300 f4-f5.6.  I bought this lens to fill the gap between the two.I haven't had this new lens very long, but here are my initial impressions...  First, it's shorter (when zoomed out), lighter and smaller in diameter than the 17-55 f2.8 lens that was previously our typical carry-around lens.  Obviously, it doesn't work as well in low light as the f2.8 lens, but that's to be expected.  Still, it takes very nice pictures, and doesn't seem too limited by the smaller aperture.  The colors seem accurate, and the IS seems to work very well.The barrel doesn't rotate, either when zooming or focusing, so it is possible to use filters that rely on a fixed orientation.  This is not the case with my 70-300mm zoom...that lens rotates as it focuses.  Though it isn't a big deal to me, others might be more concerned with this.My only complaint with this lens is that, unlike my other two Canon IS USM zoom lenses, it will extend under it's own weight when the camera is facing down.  And there is no lock (again, unlike my other two lenses) to keep it in it's shortest length during transport.  This annoys me when I'm carrying the camera.Comparing pictures taken with this lens to those taken with my 70-300 lens (at 70 and 135...the widest two lengths common to both lenses)...this lens seemed to have slightly more vivid colors, and a wider DOF.  The depth of field was to be expected, I'd think, given the shorter lens and slightly larger aperture.  The more vivid colors, I guess, could be explained the same way, though the difference was very small.  Both lenses produced very nice results, IMO.My lens was a white-box lens...which was not mentioned in the product description.  I half-expected this, given that the price I paid was low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.  But I would like to have seen the item description accurately state this up front.  The lens came wrapped in a single layer of bubble-wrap inside a plain white cardboard box.  This was, in turn, shipped inside a slightly larger box and padded with packing paper.  There was no documentation or software included (save for the warranty card, which WAS included), as you'd get with a lens sold in retail packaging...so be aware that this is the case.  Nonetheless, my lens arrived quickly, and intact.  My order was fulfilled by ALLTIMEDEALS."}], "B000092YQW": [{"review_id": "35b626ae36d7cf165d645a27b810d100", "review": "I like the headphones for the most part.

It's quite a stunning thing to see photos with this lens shot with a little XSi. Once you have enough skill to get your modes set right you can be shooting portraits, animals, flowers, product shots (I do a lot of that) and a ton of other great stuff with this bit of glass.If your shooting a crop body like I do, you'll need a wide angle lens for those landscape and indoor shots where this thing doesn't get wide enough. I use a Sigma 20mm f/1.8 for those times. It's a great standard lens for crop bodies, the sharpness and depth of field effects you can get from opening up that big 1.8 aperture are stunning.But this Tamron zoom is no slouch either when it comes to bokeh and sharpness. Stop it down to 4 or so and in decent light it will give you excellent sharpness, contrast and color. I find I seldom reach for the 20mm except when I want to get right up next to a flower or insect or maybe a piece of jewelry in a product photo, open the aperture and get really smeared backgrounds.You can do that with the Tamron. But the Sigma seems to produce the better backgrounds in those situations. You just have to get real close and personal with the camera.Last fall we were camping at a local reservoir in central PA during the height of the fall colors when I found a huge spider in a fully formed, quite beautiful web. It had recently rained and the web had a lot of those nice dewy droplets on its filaments. I was able, with this Tamron, to get very close to spidey and web, choke off a lot of depth of field and soften the water and multicolored trees in the background to a beautiful palette of color with only hints of shape. That was one of the best series of shots I've ever taken, and it was with this lens. Stopped down a bit to give more form to the background and spidey was in a whole new light.This lens works for weddings and birthdays, school plays, picnics, tourism, whatever.If you need more zoom than this, maybe you should buy a telescope. I can see needing a wider lens than this, but if you can't zoom close enough, shoot RAW and enlarge. This zoom range is perfect for 90% of my image composition within the range it shoots.It's much easier to compose than with my 20mm Sigma prime. Any prime lens will have you walking around, backing up, moving in, trying to get that frame right. The payoff is unbeatable sharpness and speed per dollar.However, this 2.8 zoom lens is plenty fast, and very sharp as well.I bought this lens a couple years ago for under $400. The Sigma prime cost more than that, and I only use it for about ten percent of my shots.This thing is so far beyond the price in terms of capability, that I will buy another one if this one ever breaks.Recommended."}], "B0000BZOGJ": [{"review_id": "2e675cc6ca63d7052aa195f41fada781", "review": "I purchased this just this week, and while it holds myHP Pavilion DV9830US 17\" Laptopsufficiently, it's not what I hoped for.

There is also a front flap that's not sealed, so if you're caught in the rain that compartment will get water in it.Overall, I wasn't clear on who they designed this for.

I went from 7 stations and 15 channels to 17 stations and 43 channels. The furthest is +55 miles. Another is 42 miles... NO problem with either. However most of my stations are with in 22 miles and mostly in one direction. I would say if all your stations are out +40 miles this should work but you might start to thing about an outdoor Bow-Tie antenna. HOWEVER it depends on your house and terrain. If your house is wood, drywall, vinyl siding, with antenna near a second floor window facing toward the station, good to go. If you are in the middle of a brick building, no windows, you can expect less than spectacular performance (I am assuming). OUTDOOR antennas are always better, but I am very impressed. I am an engineer and my hobby is radio and antennas.Since most of my stations I care about are all in one direction I can just set and forget. However if your stations are scattered to the four winds it could be a hassle always having to aim it. Most stations are South East but one is West. It comes in no matter what direction I turn it. It is the strongest station at 17 miles. Two of the distant stations need the antenna to be aimed; they are in different directions and need the antenna to be aimed, but for the most part 90% of my stations are all in one direction.There is no real solution for stations in many directions, even with an outdoor antenna, which would need a \"ROTOR\" to turn it to different direction. With the Terk HDTVa the further out the station the more you have to aim it. This is OK and what gives the antenna it's power and low noise. However it is NOT an omnidirectional antenna. Typically omni directional antennas don't have the performance, as they are a compromise for convenience. You will never get range with an omni direction antenna. Even basic rabbit ears are bi-directional.The two petty gripes others always mention and I will repeat, is the base is narrow so it's tippy side to side. Also because the rabbit ears (the dipole whip antennas) are angled back, you have to give it room, 10\" much more depending on the angle of the base to the wall and how wide you have the whips spread out."}], "B000FBK3QK": [{"review_id": "999b7b61c64cedf96dd91a4f8f2eab7c", "review": "I like these better than APC and Tripp which have very similar units.

I also wanted to try writing versus typing on my computer. I have software that supports tablet devices, so when I found a Bamboo at a reasonable price I decided to give it a try. It proved to be a good purchase for a couple of reasons, none of which have to do with my [in]ability to draw.The device is small, just a little bigger than a mouse pad. The writing area is even smaller, being about the size of a standard index card. I wasn't sure how I would manage this area in which to work at first, but I knew the dimensions when I bought it, so no complaints.Installation was easy. I plugged it into the USB port, installed the drivers and was up and running in minutes. There were no snags in the process and no surprises.I immediately was able to start working with the tablet and found it to be an excellent substitute for a mouse, once I got used to it. The biggest hurdle was discovering that tablets do not scroll like mice - picking up the pen and moving it to a new place on the writing surface makes the pen jump on the screen. Lower left corner on the tablet = lower left corner on the screen and so on. There are very distinct advantages and disadvantages to this. On one hand, it makes pinpointing on the screen very easy and straightforward, but on the other it takes some time to adjust from relative positioning to absolute.I fired up my drawing software and experimented. Just like a real pen, the pressure on the pad can be varied to make lines drawn on the canvas stonger or softer and I was able to draw very heavy lines and very faint lines. There are 512 pressure levels, which is sufficient for the casual user like me, but more serious artists may require more fine control over the pressure.I was unsuccessful in my efforts to use it as a writing tool. It is not that it doesn't work, it is more a function of impatience on my part. I found that I could not make the adjustment to writing on an abstract surface and have it look right. Usually, the software translated my writing into the wrong thing and I would have to go back and type. I did not try very long so I didn't give this much of a chance.One thing that tripped me up was the \"flicking\" motion that could be used for scrolling once the drivers were installed. I got used to it and came to appreciate it, but at first it was frustrating because I would inadvertently flick and the canvas area would scroll.I did find that using this device has limited use when gaming. For games like chess and sudoku, it is far and away better than a regular mouse. For 3D shooters or something akin to tetris, this is absolutely the wrong device for controlling the pointer.The biggest benefit for me was in using it as a general pointing device. Holding the pen is easier on my hands than messing with a mouse, which resulted in a lot less cramping when working. I have tried trackballs, cordless mice and even the touchpad on my laptop, and none are as comfortable as the pen.I did not keep my Bamboo Small, I passed it on to my niece who is very artistic. I gave it up because, to be honest, I wanted a larger tablet. I replaced it with an Intuos4 Medium which better fits my hands.The Bamboo Small tablet and pen is an excellent entry point in the tablet market for anyone wanting to learn about tablets and how they can work out. My experience with this device was excellent and I can recommend it for its ease of setup , simple use, and in my case comfort. As I said above, the main reason I parted with mine was to get a larger tablet, but for people with smaller hands or limited budgets this is a wonderful tablet with which to start."}], "B000WOIFO2": [{"review_id": "9fdb8ec994bcb8f370a99dad7b7a8e91", "review": "DLO makes good quality accessory cases for the iPOD touch, although they are a bit pricey.

If you want a quiet computer, look for a case without fewer fan openings.  The top panel is all mesh around the fan, allowing whining case, CPU cooler, and video card sounds to emanate the top.  I think the case could provide just as much cooling with the addition of another front intake fan, but with a solid panel around the top fan.  I'm running dual, overclocked GTX 295s in the case, and blocking off half the side fan and the top fan did not raise temperatures any.  Temps are very good, it's just that the ventilation is overkill at the expense of noise.

Sorry Canon, I really like your products, but KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES for goodness sake!!!! (Excuse the rant) I've tried just about EVERY point and shoot that takes some kind of video, plus countless other digital cameras over the years. The HD P&S;'s I've tried are: Canon TX1, Panasonic TX5, several flash drive camcorders that also take still pic's, Sanyo HD1000 & HD700, Samsung HV24HD, and ALL the Kodak's that take HD Video. Plus there has been other camera's - too many to mention (i.e. Canon 550, 770, etc.)Anyway, I just bought (and returned) the SX10. I really wanted to love this camera, but will stick with my Sony T500 for now (check my review of the T500 - that little baby is a keeper).To keep it short, the still pictures are what you would expect from a Canon, but actually, I think my old Canon G7 takes better pictures. But here are the grips (I prefer the cons in a review more than the pros) in no particular order.1) The Camera is BIG. Easy to hold but BIG. Love the flip screen - but the camera is BIG. Great lens - but BIG. I guess what I'm trying to say, the damn thing is BIG, almost as big as a DSLR. This is something that you can not just slip in your pocket and run! I guess I would put up with the BIGness of the camera if the video was better (see below).2) Battery: some might like it, but I did not. Four \"AA\" batteries! I had to buy a rather expensive charger and rechargeable batteries. Come on, what's going on here! Now adays with all this new technology, Canon couldn't come up with a small battery that holds a decent charge! I know the Sony T500 has poor battery life, but at least the camera is small - you would expect that! Who wants to schlep around 4 extra \"AA\" batteries - not me! This one was my fault, I did not ever read about the batteries before I bought the camera, but like above, if the Video was better, I could look the other way.3) Video: This was pretty important to me (again check out the T500). What is up with only the small video format when EVERY other camera company is opting for new 16:9 widescreen format? Again, my old G7 takes just as good \"small\" video and I can play/edit it with anything! Actually, the video from the SX10 is not all that good, except the fact that you can zoom all the way in (actually that is pretty cool), but not worth keeping it. I was hoping that even though the SX10 was not widescreen 720/1080, it would take decent \"HD like\" video with the new .MOV video format. Why Canon did not bring the SX1 out first I'll never know; because then if the videos were good - I might have kept the Canon. As many other reviewers have mentioned, I just don't understand these companies or their marketing plan. If they need any help, all they have to do is ask a few geeks like me - I'll tell em' an ear full!So all in all, I'm keeping the Sony T500 - even if the pictures are not quite as sharp. That little camera is all I need - \"right now\"!

On sale, it was the same price as the Nostromo and I am a huge Razer fan and can't live without my Naga and Vespula. That said, I have always only used Logitech keyboards and headsets and I love them just as much. This truly was a difficult decision for me and I pored over the reviews of both for days.I'm so happy with the choice I made. I can't speak to the Nostromo as I haven't used one, but I can't imagine life being any better than it is with my G13 right now. Let me say straight out, this is not as valuable for non-MMO type games which require a ridiculous number of hotkeys to perform at your best. Games like Skyrim where you're basically just moving around with WASD and attacking with two buttons will not see the huge improvements that your MMOs will experience, but it's still a very nice upgrade in terms of comfort, especially for laptop users. The G13 will serve you well in any game that requires the keyboard because it allows your wrist and arm to be in a more natural position. I can completely relax my arm rather than have to try to hover over the keyboard for long gaming sessions. I have found that the G13 works amazingly well even when not on a flat surface. I regularly play in bed on my laptop and I usually rest the base of the G13 against my thigh so that it's at an angle to the bed (if that makes sense!) and this is surprisingly awesome. I have no loss in control over playing on a flat surface and my arm can be completely relaxed at my side the entire time. It's easily tied for the best accessory you can buy for your gaming laptop, equaled only byRazer Naga MMOG Laser Gaming Mouse. Paired with aRazer Vespula Dual-Sided Gaming Mouse Matyou will only have to touch your keyboard if you use text to chat. If you use voice chat over Ventrilo or Teamspeak, your keyboard will be collecting dust from lack of use. What I love about this setup is the ability to have both of my hands at my sides when I'm using my gaming laptop and I'm supremely comfortable. Mobile gaming is the future and I want to be able to take my games with me and be comfortable wherever I play while still being as effective as possible. The G13 is a huge part of what makes this possible.Now don't get me wrong, I also love my G13 with my desktop PC. The profiles are stored on the gameboard so I can easily move it from computer to computer with no issue. It works great on a desk being nicely weighted and with a good grip on the base. It doesn't slip or give without excessive force (and no one games THAT hard!). The design is also perfect. I was truly concerned because I have smaller hands and that is actually a big factor behind this purchase. With smaller hands, it's hard to reach across a keyboard to hit all those hotkeys. I read a lot of reviews claiming the G13 is not kind to small hands but I have not found that to be the case. With my palm resting comfortably on the designated rest, I can easily reach the top row of keys. The furthest on the left and right are a bit of a stretch for constant use but I find G1 in the upper left is perfect for TAB and targeting mobs. The one just below is nice for SPACE or jump. I use the top five center keys for 1-5 and the five directly below for 6-10. I have no trouble accessing any of them at any time and I adjusted to the new positions really quickly, faster than I learned to use my Razer Naga by far. I mapped the keys near the joystick to M and L for map and quest log. And of course, the joystick has completely replaced my WASD keys for movement. Moving with a joystick is so natural, especially for console gamers, even casual ones like myself. I have none of the issues others have mentioned about it hurting their thumbs or being hard to push. A very gentle push is all that's needed to continuously move forward. Diagonals are possible also. I tend to hold forward on the joystick and mouse steer because that's what I'm used to, but I find myself turning with the joystick more and more and it works great. Now my fingers are completely free to access my primary hotkeys rather than trying to contort my hand to reach WASD keys and hotkeys simultaneously. I have my secondary hotkeys assigned to my Razer Naga and I'm good to go with split second response time thanks to all keys being within my natural reach without straining.The best tip I can give new users who are having trouble accessing keys is to remap them manually for each game that you play. It really only takes a few minutes to do and once it's done, you don't have to worry about it again. By default, WoW's map is set up so that the center keys on the gameboard are assigned to WASD. This made no sense to me because I wanted to get away from using my fingers for movement and do it all with my thumb on the joystick. The key profiling software is very user friendly and easy to understand without ever looking at the manual. You just click the G key you want to change in the interface, and then press the key you want it to be. Easy. I remapped all my keys so that they would work for ME. I appreciate all the effort Logitech put into pre-designing key layouts for so many games, but ultimately what's going to work best for you is a layout you choose yourself. Pick keys that are easy to reach (which should be most of them, even for small hands) for your primary abilities and use the ones that are a bit of a stretch (if any) to lesser used functions, like map, bag and quest log. I've seen so many reviews where people complain that the keys aren't in the right place. Change them!My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner. The G13 has changed my gaming for the better, and with kids, school and work, I want the most out of my game time, and now I have it. Thank you once again, Logitech!"}, {"review_id": "85ea2406e0b95e199cfc085e85078be6", "review": "So, a one star is pretty harsh.Especially considering that I still use the G13, and aside from the Nostromo (before Razer took it over), it's the best out there of its kind. Fortunately for Logitech there aren't many companies bothering to design these types of keypads.It's made well enough. No complaints regarding the build quality.The problems lay in the design.I don't know who designed the thumb stick, but if you don't replace it yourself (which requires taking the device apart, or gluing/sanding) it's just terrible as a AWSD input. Anyways, I would fire the designer of it. He clearly is not good. Even the five star reviews will tell you that.The LCD is a gimmick. I don't know what else to say about it. The only reason you'll probably use it is to swap profiles, which I'll mention in the next part.The software is terrible. Sometimes you'll have to program the device every time you boot up, because the file won't save correctly. Even worse is that it will sometimes revert back to an older setting, or lose a profile, months after you thought it finally was working.So, what does this all mean. Well, because the Nostromo is no longer as good as it once was, we're pretty much stuck with the G13. On the other hand, Logitech did a terrible job on it, considering the price point. It's basically a bunch of keys, a worthless LCD screen, a terrible joystick, and bad software to make it worse.Hopefully a competitor will go into this niche field and design something better. Logitech is obviously more interested in making it look fancy, than having it work well.***EDIT***Well, at the time of this editing \"0 of 7 people found this review helpful.\" It's possible that all of them work at Logitech; who knows. I've adjusted the review to now be 3 stars, mostly because I was probably a little overly harsh. The fact is, I still own and use my G13. It's not perfect, especially considering the price point for what is essentially a mini keyboard with a silly LCD and bad joystick, but it's still the best product in the niche field (once modified by the owner). That said, if Razer goes back to the quality of the original Nostromo produced by Belkin, then I will be switching brands."}], "B001P9EQH8": [{"review_id": "d66a0cfba0183b9ce31463d03716b8b2", "review": "Up until a couple of weeks ago, I had never heard of a headphone amp. Well, I guess part of the reason is that I never owned a good pair of phones. I recently bought a pair ofSennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone(here on Amazon), which are tight (see my review). The Senns have pretty high impedance (50 ohms), and my netbook and ipod don't have enough juice to power it. Therefore, the need for a headphone amp arose.One of the first HP amps that I came across was the FiiO F5. I had never heard of this brand. I think a reviewer mentioned that its Chinese. Anyhoo, The features that hooked me was its price, size(it's the same size as the iPod shuffle), and simplicity. Seeing a majority of positive reviews, I decided to go for it. I received it in 3 days from Head-Direct (which I would recommend since it was under $25 with shipping, and they use Amazon for payment).Upon first trial through my iPod, I was a little miffed because there was a high frequency \"noise\", is the best way I can describe it. But it went away when I played the music, and it never recurred. I played music with, and without the amp, and the difference is quite remarkable. With thew FiiO connected, aside from a big boost in volume, the depth is also enhanced. The bass boost is subtle, but noticable. I would recommend maxing out the volume on the amp and controlling the volume from the source, as the button is quite small and right next to the output plug.Other than the sound, the things I like about it is its size, internal rechargeable battery, on/off button, clip, and blue/red  light, which indicates when it is on/off or charging/charged. It also comes with a 6\" and 3' cord, and a USB to mini USB charging cable.The only things I can think of that I don't like is the fact that it charges through the computer, which means that, 1) you need access to a computer, and 2) the computer has to be on. I also find it a little disturbing that the instruction manual states that the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times, BUT the battery will eventually wear out and is irreplaceable. Hopefully, it will last 25 bucks worth of charges! Which brings me to question how long the charge will last. And since I just got it, I have yet to figure that out.

You can do all that with the menu and the digital output... Toslink... if you have a newer AV receiver.  It accepts an SD card for pictures, but haven't used that, nor the ipod dock.

I suspect you could pair that $118 blu ray/dvd upscaler to this tv... plug in usb pictures that way, but this is only a supposition.My one small beef was installing the base... not enough to drop a star.  Get yourself a pair of needle nose pliers and #2 medium sized phillips head screw driver if you do not have them,  before attempting the assembly.  You must lay the TV face down on a table (use a towel to protect it), then slide the base's steel attaching plate into the center of the bottom of the TV, and align the plate's 4 screw holes, slide each of the screws carefully down a 2 inch deep, 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch \"tunnel\" (using needle nose pliers) and then \"drop\" them into the holes, hoping they stand up.... stick the phillips head screwdriver down... catch the screw and screw it in.  Took about 10 minutes of fiddling instead of 30 seconds if it were better designed.

Living in Wisconsin, I am a die-hard Packers fan, and being a nursing student, cable is just too expensive for me. I started researching this antenna out of desperation because the antenna tower setup at my rental house is very outdated, and the cable connecting the antennas that are at the top of the 60ft tower is so thin, it looses an immense amount of signal. Anyway, I live about 36 miles from the Milwaukee towers, and about 50 from the Chicago towers. I already had the Antennacraft HBU33, which is an absolutely PHENOMENAL antenna if you are more then 40 miles from a tower (I have never used it for signals more the 50 miles away, so keep that in mind). This antenna (ANT751R, and make sure the \"R\" is at the end of the model number, as the model with the \"R\" is optimized for digital signal, as opposed to the older model which was more for analog signal) is designed for signals within the 40 mile range. I used my old antenna for Chicago stations, and bought this antenna for the Milwaukee stations. The setup works very well so far. I use both antennas with a signal combiner (a splitter that works both ways) and a RCA TVPRAMP1R for a pre-amp, and the picture so far is awesome. This antenna is so small, it seems like it would be ineffective, but WOW, its works like a champ! I will warn you that it does not pick up the lower VHF stations very well (2-6), so I had to modify it with coathangers to pick up those stations (Fox is channel 6 here, which a majority of Packer games are on). I did have to change the location of the antenna after not getting good reception on fox, even with adjustments with coathangers, to a higher place with fewer obstructions (the original place was clamped to the antenna tower as high as I could reach (which was about 10 ft up with a ladder), and was obstructed by the house next door, so your antenna may not have the low VHF issue, but I am not willing to take off my coathanger modification to find out if it works without it (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) in the new location. It is now on the roof of my porch, which is about 20 feet in the air. I also installed this antenna in the attic of my friend's 1 story house who is about 15 miles form the Milwaukee tower, and he reports perfect reception even without any sort of amp. Keep in mind that he was using a radio shack amplified set-top antenna before with a 15-20db amp built in, and on windy days, the reception would be choppy at best. He checked the reception on the day that the winds from hurricane Sandy were really bad in his area, and reported the signal was completely solid, so there you go. When installing this antenna, I would HIGHLY recommend using quad-shielded type f coax cable, to minimize signal loss. I would recommend purchasing the cable from monoprice, they were the lowest price when I installed my friend's antenna. Also, be careful with amplifiers, they can actually destroy your signal if your signal is already strong, so just keep that in mind. If you are at the very edge of the reception zone for this antenna, and your antenna is in a low place, or in your attic, then you may want to look into a pre-amp, otherwise, don't even bother.So to recap: This is a fantastic antenna that may not pick up the low VHF stations very well. I made a long loop with a coathanger and used hose clamps to attach them to the end of the VHF elements to get better low VHF signal, but that's just a suggestion. If you are putting the antenna up high, you may not have anything to worry about it. USE QUAD-SHIELDED TYPE F CABLE FOR YOUR SETUP TO MAXIMIZE GAIN AND MINIMIZE SIGNAL LOSS."}], "B0026FCI2U": [{"review_id": "e26e0644642218136d31fcea0993c89b", "review": "I was disappointed with this purchase because I felt mislead on what I was looking for. Last year I built my first P9X79 Deluxe system using the Cooler Master HAF 932 Advanced Full Tower and was very happy with its quiet fans. With a Nuactua NH-D14 CPU cooler. This thing is almost silent. Because I need all the processing power and memory I can get within a budget, I opted to build a second similar system to add as a render Farm box. I bought a base P9X79 with the exact same 3930K, 64GB memory, power supply, CPU cooler and SSD drives. Not needing all the bells a whistles from the deluxe board I also decided to get the midsized HEF 922. Having a quiet computer is very important to me and this is the reason I chose to stick with The HAF series. Once I got the new system assembled, I was very disappointed to hear the roar of fans from the fans in the 922. The noise levels from the fans stated on the website do not match those printed on the owners manual. (23dBA vs 19dBA) The HAF 922 is far louder then the 932. What ever Cooler master changed in terms of cooling fans, it is clearly not at the same quality of the 932. The noise level is not something I can live with every day so I had to decide weather to return the box at my own expense and time to disassemble, pack, ship and reassemble, or buy some new fans. In order to get a similar low noise level enjoyed by the 932, I have to replace all three of the factory fans and add an optional 200 mm fan to the side. I understand there is a fine line between the open air design of the HEF for cooling and vs noise level but the HAF 932 design is almost the same as the 922 and vary quiet if all other components are low noise. Cooler Master claims the same quality in a mid size tower. All said and done, I should have bought another HAF 923 and save myself the time and dissatisfaction with Cooler Master. At this point, the only thing Cooler master could do for me is send me new fans or reimburse me for the price I paid for 19dBA versions."}], "B002DW99H8": [{"review_id": "1bbe0790e85caab05b6ab58fa4e0f567", "review": "I just received this little guy today, and I must say that I am very impressed with the design.

However, upon configuring it properly, I managed to get a better DL speed and a somewhat improved UL speed as well. Also, I recently tested it on two other Wi-Fi networks. There was improvement in the internet access speeds in both cases. In one of networks the improvement was significantly higher, exceeding my initial expectations.The product took a while to install, partly because it was counter-intuitive, and partly because it didn't have proper help on the GUI. Eventually I figured it out and it started working alright.As I don't use Win 7, I cannot rate its compatibility with this OS.The range is alright, meeting my expectations. Strangely, if it's a few feet away from the router, the signal is just \"Good\" or \"Very good\" at times, although it should be \"Excellent\" at all times (after all, it's in close proximity and without any physical objects in between). However, it sometimes is \"Excellent\" despite the distance or physical obstacles being in between the adapter and the router.The USB extension cord accessory is a plus, since it allows you to relocate the adapter to optimize its performance. It didn't improve things much in my case though. Still, it's a useful thing to have, particularly if you are using it with a desktop computer, or with a laptop at home.Bottom line: this product is definitely an improvement but not so easy to get it working as it might seem. It's definitely worth the twenty bucks though and, just like the Medialink router, it is a very reliable and handy piece of technology."}], "B0038KTAXW": [{"review_id": "e84d476c6ff15f36b306f977c1b4a0b4", "review": "Affordable protection for your notebook, but it can only carry the basics.

The design is almost as the same, just the power switch and the mode dial exchanged their places. One significant addition - a GPS mark on the top, right above the lens. The blue color is not that dark as on TZ5 and not so striking bright as on ZR1. A slight dent on the back with some prominence on the right side makes a very convenient grip to operate with one hand. A metal body looks pretty solid, however it is not that heavy.PERFORMANCE: The new camera has a pretty good performance: the startup time is a little bit more than 1 sec and with almost zero shutter lag. Taking into account a new very quick \"Sonic Speed\" auto focus, which takes about 0.35-0.4 sec, you will be able to catch virtually every spur-of-the-moment photo. And a dedicated movie button allows starting video recording at any time without any preparation.LENS: Leica lens is just excellent: unusually big for a so small body 12x zoom starting with the very convenient for indoors shooting 25mm up to telephoto 300mm (equiv.) plus a quick and precise auto focus (however might be somewhat slower in low-light), and good optical image stabilization in conjunction with the digital one which allows you to take sharp pictures in the entire zoom range and at the very low shutter speed around 1/8 and even 1/4. The auto-focusing and optical image stabilization work in absolute silence, and the only zooming produces some soft \"sh-sh-sh\" noise. Good news - without any start/stop clicks on the footage :).DISPLAY: A large 3-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with 460K pixels has a very good contrast and saturation - the pictures look very \"juicy\". The brightness also is high enough to be seen even in a direct sun-light (just a bit darker) and in a wide angle of view. All that allows to share photos and videos immediately with other people.MENU: For those who used the Panasonic P&S; cameras before the ZS7 menu looks very familiar, just some new items added. Also there is a Quick-Menu button which is very helpful for a quick access to the most frequently used settings. The new camera has such a luxury as the Aperture, Shutter speed, and Manual modes and there is a new Exposure button (next to the video one) which allows to set manually the aperture using the Left-Right buttons and the shutter speed with Up-Down buttons.AUTO SETTINGS: The best in the industry Panasonic's Intelligent Auto mode is getting better with each new model. Actually it's a whole bunch of sophisticated algorithms which help to take really nice pictures with minimum efforts. They are worth to be aware about so here is a brief list of most effective of them.\"Intelligent Scene Selector\" - It quickly analyzes the light conditions as well as focusing results and selects either portrait, scenery, macro, night portrait or night scenery. It also displays a small icon of the chosen scene in the top left corner. The feature is extremely helpful when you need to shoot very fast on spur-of-the-moment.\"Intelligent ISO\" - If camera detects that your subject is moving, it raises ISO and shutter speed to take shots without motion blur, otherwise it will try to keep the lowest possible ISO to reduce noise and to get nice clear pictures.\"Intelligent Exposure\" - it's a kind of a small brother of the High Dynamic Range feature. If the camera sets the correct overall exposure but some areas happen to be too dark, this feature automatically increases the brightness of the dark areas to make the entire picture to look more balanced. It also pretty effective for the backlight conditions - instead of getting just a silhouette of your subject against the bright sky it makes the subject normally exposed but without washing out the nice blue sky.\"Face Detection\" - is another great thing for taking good-quality pictures of people. It happened to me a number of times in the past that a presence in the frame of a more contrast element somewhere behind the person I'm taking picture of was making the camera to adjust focus at that unimportant distant object and therefore made the major person out-of-focus. The same way if there is a bright background behind the person then the camera will measure the luminance of that background while the person's image will be pretty much underexposed (dark). The Face Detection feature identifies the human faces and tells the camera to adjust focus and exposure for the faces first so the people on the picture will be looking well exposed, clear and sharp.ADVANCED FEATURES: I guess the most interesting and advanced is a new \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature. Actually it combines a sophisticated noise reduction with a new picture enhancement algorithm. This feature automatically identifies the 3 type of the picture areas: outlines, detailed textures, and smooth gradation panes and provides an optimized handling for each of them separately. As a result the photo looks sharper at the edges and more clean in between. Many old P&S; cameras had pretty fast picture quality degradation at the ISO around 300-400 and higher. The shots taken by ZS7 even at ISO 400 look pretty good on the small and even medium-size prints.IMAGE QUALITY: Imagine on a sunny day you take an outdoors picture of a wall made of the new brown bricks with a $3000 DSLR and a small P&S; camera from the distance about 6-8 feet. How could you recognize by which camera was taken a certain shot? The subject is plain so no Depth-of-Field is involved into comparison. However in this example the two characteristics will help to distinct the cameras: 1) The edges of bricks will be well outlined on DSLR shots and a kind of fuzzy on the P&S; ones; 2) The new bricks do not have any structure on their sides, they are just plane and so exactly that way they will look on the DSLR shots, while on the P&S; ones their sides will show more or less amount of noise. If you perform the same test for an evenly cut line of bushes (again DOF is not involved) you will see the same result plus the internal structure of each leaf will be more clear on the DSLR photos. So to make pictures taken with your P&S; camera looking like the DSLR ones the P&S; camera should make the outlines sharper, clean the noise on the plane or soft gradation areas, and slightly emphasize the internal structures, if any. That is exactly what the new \"Intelligent Resolution\" (IR) feature tries to do.The \"iAuto\" mode in ZS7 is organized the way that you will have decent, good photos in virtually any situation right out-of-the-box. The several hundreds shots I took by now look good on my 24\" display and so they will on the similar size prints. But if you look at them at 100% crop (magnification) then on many of them you might find some areas which do not look natural. If the IR-algorithm decides about a certain low-contrast part on your picture that it's a plane area then it will remove all the noise altogether with all the subtle details from that part of the picture. If you take a picture of a big tree with hundreds of branches (but without leaves) against a bright sky the IR-feature will treat it as a structured area and will slightly sharpen it to look clearer. But when you take a landscape picture with many distant trees in front and behind, those hundreds of crossing branches will create a low-contrast pattern which together with internal sensor's noise might look for IR-algorithm as just a noisy plain area and so it will obliterate all the details leaving only some average color in that part of the picture and so making it looking very unnatural. The thing is that unlike the previous models the noise reduction in ZS7 is pretty strong. I would not call it \"aggressive\" but it's really strong.QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: There is a way how to get the best out of this camera while shooting landscapes on sunny days. Here is a recipe for experienced amateurs:- Switch the mode dial to the program \"P\" mode.- Press the Menu button and select the lowest ISO 80 instead of \"Auto\" (this is the key-point! If there is no enough light to set that low ISO it will not work).- Make sure you have the \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature on!- Find on the 4th page of the shooting menu the item \"PICT.ADJ.\" and press the right button to go inside. You will see the 4 pictures attributes:CONTRASTSHARPNESSSATURATIONNOISE REDUCTION- A default value for each of them is \"0\". Set \"-1\" for contrast (to reduce the clipping of highlights), \"+1\" for sharpness, leave the saturation unchanged, and most important set noise reduction to \"-1\" or even to its minimum \"-2\". Take this advice as a starting point and try to play with the SHARPNESS and NOISE REDUCTION settings and see what looks more appropriate for you, because some people prefer more sharpness while the others are more concern about noise visibility, so try different settings and choose which one looks better for you.Those settings will allow you to take the most sharp and detailed pictures of landscapes, architecture, etc. if you like that. However you should be alert and check periodically the quality of pictures and if something is going wrong then switch immediately to \"iAuto\" mode. The ZS7's intelligent auto-mode is very sophisticated and might take into account the parameters you're not even aware about. For example, if you apply the full zoom then the aperture drops to a small F/4.9 value giving much less light for the sensor and additionally at that huge focal length 300mm (equiv.) the impact of your shaking hands might be as so much that the optical image stabilization can not completely compensate it and so the camera will have to increase the shutter speed to have the picture un-blurred. In that tough scenario the only high ISO around 300-400 might satisfy all those conditions and the camera will normally set it in auto-mode. But if you keep shooting recklessly at ISO 80 without getting the feedback such kind of pictures might be spoiled in some way. So, use this recipe only if you know what you're doing.Update: Having using ZS7 for a while I've identified the 3 major types of pictures depending what is most important for you on those shots: 1) The main part are the areas with soft gradations like human faces, petals of flowers on macro shots, etc; 2) Mixed content of plain areas and patterns with no central subject; 3) Landscapes with plenty of trees, branches and leaves or small flowers. The above proposed recipe is most effective for the last category - it will give you the sharpest pictures with no low-contrast areas smeared by the strong noise reduction and on the other hand the higher level of noise will be effectively hidden by the complex image structure. For the 2nd category it would be wiser to decrease noise reduction just to -1 (not -2) to make the noise less visible on some plain areas, and for the 1st category it seems better to keep the default neutral setting since to have less noise on the human's face is much more important than lack of minor details around. Anyway you'll still have the advantage of less noise at minimum ISO.I did some comparative testing of ZS7 with my Nikon D90 to find out how much that new IR technology and the above mentioned recommendations could help to improve the overall picture quality. I've uploaded some pictures and put a link into my comments dated 04/24/2010 with the title \"Compare to Nikon D90\". Don't assume, just take a look - you might be a bit surprised :-)LOW LIGHT: Recently I performed a brief comparative test of my P&S; cameras: Panasonic ZS7 and Sony TX7. Shortly - their low-light performance (in normal mode) is very similar. The medium-size 8\"x10\" prints without much cropping look good up to ISO 400. At ISO 800 there is a noticeable drop of the image quality of both cameras and at 1600 the shots look decent only for 4\"x6\" prints. Generally the Sony TX7's shots look smoother because of more aggressive noise reduction while the Panasonic ZS7's ones display slightly more details along with a little bit more noise. So it's the matter of taste to decide which shots look better. I would admit that at ISO 1600 while the Panasonic's shots became much more blurred because of the increased noise reduction strength, the Sony's shots became poured with much coarse noise which got even stronger at ISO 3200 making the pictures completely unusable. So neither of these cameras could be considered as great low-light performers.In case when the shots become too dark because of big lack of light you can select the \"HIGH SENS.\" (sensitivity) scene. The camera will automatically choose a high ISO in the range 1600 - 6400 and decrease resolution to 3MP (it was stated 3200-6400 but in some tests my camera set ISO 1600). It will not provide better quality but at least will allow to increase the picture's brightness.NOTE! This camera is great outdoors, but if many of your pictures are indoors or in low-light environment then you'd better look for some other cameras like Panasonic LX5/LX3 or GF1, Canon S95/S90 or G12/G11, Fujifilm F80EXR, etc. which were designed especially for those conditions. The original model name of this camera is \"TZ\" which stands for \"Travel Zoom\" i.e. it was designed for travel outdoors, not for indoors.DYNAMIC RANGE: means the difference between the most light and dark areas on the picture. If you're taking the shots of your friends on a sunny day with a bright blue sky above and some bushes with green leaves aside and those bushes happen to be in the shadow of a nearby building then the difference between brightness of the sky and the bushes will be thousands of times. On the shots taken by a camera with narrow dynamic range only one element - your friends might look good, but the sky will be completely washed out to white and the bushes will be almost black. For the cameras with a decent DR like ZS7 at least two elements of that picture will look good i.e. either your friends with a nice blue sky while the bushes will be very dark, or the friends and bushes good but the sky pretty much wiped out. The new Panasonic ZS7 has the two solutions to help in such situations: the \"Intelligent Exposure\" feature and the \"High Dynamic (range)\" scene.Although both solutions aim at the same goal they work in a different way and should be used in different situations. The \"Intelligent Exposure\" feature once it is activated via the main or quick menu puts its white icon to the lower left corner and starts constantly analyzing the picture. If the difference in brightness of some significant areas of the picture exceeds a certain threshold then the icon becomes yellow and that feature decreases the overall contrast of the picture. Since that threshold is very high that feature would be mostly useful on the bright sunny days. Its effectiveness is not that big but it still can be helpful and anyway it's better than nothing so you can have it turned on all the time. The \"High Dynamic\" scene should be used only in low light conditions because even in a bright sun it will unconditionally set ISO 400 (or even higher) and decrease the shutter speed. Such a high ISO will greatly increase the amount of noise and therefore will cause a more aggressive noise reduction which will actively obliterate small details. That scene provides much more effective dynamic range compression but at the cost of significantly decreased picture quality. If you're shooting in a low-light condition you have nothing to loose, but if you're taking pictures on a nice day with a plenty of sunshine the loss of quality might greatly disappoint you, so that scene should be used only for the low-light shooting.MOVIE MODE: By now I tried only the advanced AVCHD movie mode - it looked very well. Apart from the processing the still images in this model Panasonic applied their new \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature to video recording as well and the result is just gorgeous! Because of that special processing personally its 720p HD looks even better than from my Sony TX7 with its full 1080 HD resolution.So this new Panasonic ZS7 camera is a very good device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording."}], "B003ES5ZSW": [{"review_id": "97e2291468e552b55a1580f070017116", "review": "The cord itself is great, its long, and it isn't stiff, so its quite useful, but the micro end of the cord is just odd.

Because it's so small and light, you can easily get a mount to attach it right on top of your camera.Two things you should know about.1. There is no wind screen, so either use it inside or get one.  The microphones are super sensitive, and can pick up the smallest sounds... so wind will be a problem if you don't get a good windscreen.2. The case itself is sensitive...

It was nice to see how bright it was even during the daytime, windows all on one side of the room but no strong light as it is the start of winter and a basement.  Summer time it would be good to have curtains for light control like any projector.  When I get curtains up I am sure that will take care of any issues during daytime, even in summer. Of course as with any projector the more control over light in the room the better the picture. I did a lot of research before purchasing this unit. As a projector unless one has a totally dark room meaning zero light and dark walls then ANSI lumens are important, this one with its 2000 ANSI LUMENS is great and use this to compare with other projectors, if less I would be weary.I wanted to have a NATIVE 1080P RESOLUTION which I do not regret and would not get a projector with lower resolution. One may notice that a projectors specs say they can do 1080 but this is misleading as this is not NATIVE resolution, meaning they try to upconvert to a 1080i (i=interpolated) and it is not the same thing, not even close. I want to see blu rays in their full resolution which this does. One may also purchase an A/V receiver to upconvert the source material for best picture quality, my Blu Ray player also does this upconversion, but it is still not a true 1080P. While not as good as the 1080P one will see when playing a Blu Ray disc for example, the picture from HD cable channel which is 720P is still AMAZING just as good as the picture on my 42 inch LCD HDTV and better than my older 55 inch rear projection HDTV. High Def video from a home video source such as full 1080P from an AVCHD format camcorder for example is stunning and home movies look as good or better than store bought if done properly. The input source is of course going to dictate how good the picture is, so it will look as good as the source input, this is not always the case with all projectors, they have to have the capacity to project the image at full input resolution such as this one. Most projectors that have this resolution cost more and a flat panel in the screen sizes this is capable of are going to be many thousands of dollars more.I do not use the Eco setting but the bulbs last 3-4000 hours and are only around 120.00 and you only need one which is a very good deal.  One of the great and unique features of this projector are the LENS SHIFT adjustment wheels, this projector does not have to be dead center on with the screen as those knobs can shift the picture both vertically and horizontally, at least several inches or more depending on how far the projector is away from the screen, in some situations this could mean the difference between having a projector and screen work in a room or not. The lens shift moves the picture left to right or up and down keeping it in focus.  So your screen can be way off from being centered with the projector and still fit dead on.  The projector itself has plenty of features and adjustments but it did not take long to find a good setting close to out of the box. While this has 2 HDMI inputs I only use one with all of my components running through my A/V receiver, a Pioneer Elite VSX30 for 275 with 7.1 surround which I am very happy with.I got the Peerless mount that I think was a good choice, it fits this projector and is good quality with two nice pitch adjustment knobs. It is white and matches the color of the projector well. Since it is ceiling mounted it is up and out of the way of my dog and one has to be right up close to the screen before one would block the picture at all, standing in between the projector and screen with this set up does not shadow the screen.If one is going to ceiling mount this you may wish to purchase a longer power cord.  I bought a 15 foot power cord for this for about 8 bucks so it is long enough to plug in to my power conditioner, extension cords are a bad idea. This worked great for my ceiling installationCables To Go 09482 18 AWG Universal Power Cord, IEC320C13 to NEMA 5-15P (15 Feet)One can run cords through walls or you can do as I did and use conduit such as the product here which hides the cord and sticks on and requires no nails.Wiremold C210 White Cordmate II Kitso it looks like a nice clean installation.I also being on a budget bought the Favi 100 inch 16:9 widescreenFAVI HD-100 16:9/100-Inch Electric Projector Screenwhich works great and provides an awesome picture with this projector.  My set up surprises everyone that it did not cost much more. It comes in various sizes but 100 inches was the biggest that would fit.  There is information here on the pages of the FAVI screens for sale which will show you the dimensions of each screen size to help determine the size screen that will fit in your room.  In my case both the horizontal fit as well as how far the screen came down was important information.While all my components are capable of 3D I have not really liked 3D that much in the theater and decided I would not want to play much 3D content at home so I concentrated on brightness and the 1080P resolution and the adjustment features of this projector and zero regrets.  If I were to change my mind in the future when the technology has progressed I can revisit that, but for now this is all I could ever want.I like this better than the movie theater.  As the screen is smaller it is easier to get a high resolution picture.  The surround sound speakers which are the Energy Take Classic 5.1 set with the Energy CF-30 floor standing speakers (I got a great deal for 150 each new) make for wonderful sound.  There is plenty of great home theater equipment out there but this was the best for my budget at the time.  I would highly recommend a good audio set up to go along with the amazing picture quality you will have with this projector.If you purchase this and want some set up help there is a web site projector central (...) where you can enter your projector model and screen size and it's contrast ratio and seating location and other information and it has a wizard that will tell you the optimum distance to mount the projector from the screen and ideal seating distances and details such as that.  Very helpful in a successful installation. I used their calculations with perfect results.I also got a Harmony 1100 remote so that I don't need 6-7 remotes,Logitech Harmony 1100 Universal Remote with Color Touch ScreenI got that new for 200.00 (heck of a deal) and extra batteries on Amazon for 8.75 eachLogitech Battery for Harmony Remote Control 1000 1100 1100i 3.7V 1250mAh.  That works like a charm with it's touch screen.  I even got a IR dimmer switch that runs off its own remote or the Harmony remote. I also got the RF accessory so I can use either RF (which is not line of sight) or RF to IR for all the components, helpful if your components are behind your seating location.I highly recommend this projector.  I would not settle for one with lower resolution or lower lumen output, you would never obtain as high resolution as a full 1080P projector and you would not get the brightness necessary for daytime viewing if you do not have a room that is completely dark. On the other hand for $1050.00 you will be quite happy with the picture you get from this especially if the source is at least HD (720P) or using its full capability of 1080P quality like a Blu Ray. t  Not that it is bad with a regular definition channel or regular DVD, but you get your most amazing picture with the best input source just as is the case with any projector or TV. I can't emphasize enough how much the 1080P quality is worth.  This projector is simply the best deal for the money I could find. Consider this, if you want a large picture you can get a very large screen such as the Favi or many others that are at least 120 inches, this projector could potentially display a giant 300 inch picture if you have the space to do so.  But even at 100 inches like I have what else can you get for that money in this size with this resolution aside from a good projector? Very little and it is going to cost a lot more. And if you have an electric screen that moves out of the way you take up very little space when not in use and the projector itself takes up very little space. Also unlike a flat panel TV you have a set picture size.  With a projector like this you can just change your screen size while using the same projector and go smaller or larger with the screen size if you change the location which either constricts the size of the screen you are able to use or enlarges the space to allow for a larger screen.  This is a flexibility you will only find in a projector.  And with the lens shift of this particular projector you have even more flexibility for placement of the projector.Also consider that this weighs about 16 pounds out of the box.  An LCD flat panel HDTV would likely weight 100 plus for a large one.  So this give you a great portability.  The 100 inch screen I am using only weighs 27 pounds.  Both of which can be carried by one person.  That can not be said about a flat panel.  Flat panels are great.  I use them in smaller sizes at reasonable prices in locations they make sense.  But for a home theater you can't beat this for anywhere near the price and you will be stunned by how great the picture is from it.I can't say enough how happy I am. I took a month to research all this and made this decision.  The first time I put a show on the screen I instantly knew it was all I had hoped for.  It gets used on a daily basis and I have now used it for about 500 hours (the projector keeps track of lamp hours used) without a single issue.  In about one minute I have a projector which is always out of the way on the ceiling taking up no usable space in the room along with a screen also not taking up any usable space to having a 100 inch incredibly high resolution viewing experience night or day.  The only adjustments I make are to the projector by selecting \"Dynamic\" during the bright day time to \"Living Room\" which is slightly dimmer to avoid seeing any pixilation at night and that only takes a few seconds from the remote to change.UPDATE: I have been using this projector for over a year now.  No problems at all during this time, and still no regrets that I purchased this unit. I do find that I still prefer either an HD video source or BluRay whenever possible but that would be the same with any projector or HDTV, particularly one with a very large screen such as this is capable of. I still only use the two settings, one for daytime and one slightly less bright for night to avoid seeing any pixilation artifacts.BULB LIFE: Well my bulb finally went.  It lasted exactly 2837 hours.  Epson says that it will last between 3000-4000 hours so it was close.  Keep in mind that I have never used the Eco setting only full power.  I would urge anyone buying a replacement bulb to ONLY USE EPSON.  There are lots of knockoffs out there which are cheap and will not have the performance, life, possibly explode or other negative things.  Only the Epson lamp is worth buying.  It is of course the most expensive and I found a new one for about $60 less from another camera supply site than Amazon is offering it for right now.  But no regrets. I have had some awesome viewing of countless movies and football games and tv shows and whatever on the huge screen with a great picture for all this time.To extend the life of your lamp make sure that it has plenty of room for air to circulate around the projector, particularly the back where the air intake and filter are.  Vacuum the air filter from time to time and replace it with a new one when you change the bulb.  Also make sure to allow the lamp to cool down before moving the projector if it is not mounted on the ceiling like mine.  Those things will help give you the longest life.  I have read of people having significantly lower lamp life and I suspect they are not doing all those things.  I also have a in room air cleaner to help keep dust down in the room I have my projector and components for the home theater.  Keep it cool and clean and you will get the best lamp life."}, {"review_id": "3e659ba69aba1d481f6077d63d7014c6", "review": "I've setup lots of projectors in the past and this one for the price has a great picture especially for under $1200.00.

Nothing fancy, nothing special, just a solid USB cable."}, {"review_id": "d148bf9f9b8f6fc666a8cd25d9515098", "review": "This cable appears to be able to satisfy the wiring requirements of adapting USB A to USB B.  I only have one piece of equipment(Video camera)that uses USB B and I could not perceive any difference between the transmission speed or quality between this cable and the one I had been using.  The cable does not have gold contacts which I believe to be of little value because the gold is usually gold plated at the minimum thickness possible.  All it takes is a few connections/disconnections to wear through the gold plating to the metal conductor unserlying the gold.  A high quality steel connector is better in the long run.  Also, the wire is not unusually thick which means that it may lose conductivity with longer cable runs.  This cable is only 10 feet long and therefore is probably well within the length where any loss of signal strength is likely to be incurred.  The plastic/rubber outer coating on the cabel is quite flexible which probably means the cable shielding within the wirea is also quite flexible.  I am a person that through experience does not throw money away on cabling and I would suggest one spend the time understanding learning what types and quality of cable are necessary to produce virtually lossless sound.  For digital signals, a reasonably price cable is probably more than enough.  For non-amplified analog signals, good cable is necessary.  For amplified analog signals, regular priced shielded cable should suffice.  For unamplified signals such as electric guitar, a lower guage high quality shielded cable is absolutely necessary, particularly if you are usinf a cable of 25 feet or more.  It is these signals which are week and are more than likely to pick up noise or frequency drop off that you would want to use higher qualities of cable.  Remember, most of the cable that \"Monster\" makes is not neceassary for your purpose and many times the only person who can hear the difference is the salesman and the poor guy who overspent on cable based upon his recommendation.  Generally the lower the initial signal strength, the better your cable may need to be.  If the initial signal strength is strong, there is a good chance you can use less expensive cable.  Cable from the amplifier to the speakers should be of lower guage but does not to be the best since the cable runs are relatively short.To close, the cables here are of decent quality good for their length and would seem to be a reasonable deal."}], "B004G603E2": [{"review_id": "b4a4c54740a351c971d7b2715b5d64e2", "review": "The 17.3\" Samsung laptop I purhcased was getting pretty hot near the keys so I ordered the largest cooler I could find on Amazon.  Cooler Master has a great reputation, so I figured I'd give this one a shot.The laptop cooler is HUGE. Seriously, they say it's for laptops up to 19\" (didn't realize they made them that big) but there is extra room around my 17 incher.  The design is pretty industrial, with the only flourishes being the light which you can thankfully turn off.  There are ugly rubber pieces all around the base, these allow for you to slide in your cables, and actually works well to reduce the clutter.The unit comes with a USB cable, a power adapter, and the stand itself.  The unit has 4 built in USB ports which are pretty awesome at reducing wear on your laptop's ports.  They're 2.0, they have a 3.0 version but it was unavailable from Amazon when I purchased this unit.  The fans are very large and can be snapped out of the unit for cleaning.Performance of the cooler is amazing, the fans blow incredibly cold air towards the laptop, through a metal mesh grill that keeps airflow moving.  My laptop doesn't have large enough vents on the bottom, so they don't really work at cooling it down at all.  Before you buy this you should make sure your laptop has bottom vents that could appreciate the extra airflow, otherwise it's just cooling down the base of your unit without helping your processor or graphics card.I'm giving it 4 stars and keeping it because the build quality is great, and the unit would work with the right laptop.  It also works as a great stand for keeping your screen at a comfortable eye level.  Just double check your unit before ordering, otherwise you might not be getting what you need.

Well now on to the review. As many other reviewers have noted, this camera is not perfect - yes, the pictures do look blurry at pixel level, the noise reduction is heavy handed, the battery takes a while to charge, the GPS is a bit slow, the flash is a bit overpowering at times and a point  I would like to note - the lens wobbles - yes, if you touch it while it is extended you will see that it has quite a bit of lateral play - don't worry it won't fall off :-). But even after all these common gripes, this is a pocket full of fun - for all you photographers out there - this camera can truly keep you entertained for months on end.This finally replaces my all time favorite P&S; - the Fuji F30 that has been traveling in my backpack nonstop for 5+ years. No, I am not disposing the F30 - I have not found a single P&S; to date that can best the low light performance and I am keeping it till the day it dies out on me.Back to the HX9V. I have only one advise for serious shooters - please do not shy away from using the scene modes and the iAuto and Superior Auto modes ... yes, it is fun to tweak the shutter speed / aperture / iso etc. in the manual and program modes. However, do remember that the best photos that you will get is when you allow the camera to do it's electronic magic on the picture processing - so while  manual modes make us happy to be in control, it is the auto modes that gets you the best shots!Before I finally zeroed down on the HX9V, I did consider both the Nikon S9100 and the Canon 230 - the Nikon lost out owing to the slightly inferior image stabilization and the Canon owing to the slightly narrower lens (28mm versus 24mm on the Sony). I am sure those two are great products as well, but to me the extended feature set of the Sony were just too compelling. And it does take very nice photos in every lighting condition that you can imagine. As you can imagine, daylight shots are a snap for this camera ... if you want to challenge it, try a low light landscape shot at 100 ISO on a tripod - the results will blow you away. Not carrying a tripod? Set it to Superior Auto and shoot hand held for a very nice result that will look great on a 8\" x 10\" print.And of course for everyone interested in shooting HD Video - this is just the best one out there now - period. It replaces my Flip UltraHD - that used to take great videos but the Sony with it's optical zoom, stereo sound AND optical image stabilization while shooting Video is just too good.Don't hesitate - this one is a winner!"}], "B004N6259G": [{"review_id": "03159e6d0d8e08ea5683588471eb78dc", "review": "I so wanted this to work out.  On paper, it was a good router for the money, it did all the things I needed of it (and then some), but in the end it didn't work out.Our setup includes the following: 1 TV hard-wired to a router for streaming Amazon Prime, etc., 2 laptops on wifi, 2 Roku boxes, 2 iPhones on wifi, 1 iPad, 1 iPod touch, and 1 PS3.The router worked almost all of the time, but that's not good enough for a router.When I first got it, it worked but would reset itself several times a day.  I finally figured out that that was due to the \"self-healing\" or whatever it's called.  When I turned that setting off in the settings, it stopped resetting itelf.  But even outside of that, I had this hooked up for a total of 3 weeks and several times it would lose connection and once I had to go uplug and replug router and modem.  The last few days before I returned it, I would be on PS3 and get random connection errors.In the good column, we have a 20.0 Mb/s connection from our ISP and it would always carry the signal at that speed through the whole of our house, which is about 3,000 sq. ft including 2 floors plus a basement.  While I never really tested trying to overload it by using Amazon Prime, PS3 and some other connections at the same time, it never seemed to lag when several family members were using the internet. Also, the router itelf looks better than most, meaning it could be out in the open in a room and not look too bad.  I liked that it has 4 ethernet outs.Also, the settings are a bit overwhelming and the software seems slow and buggy.  And any time you made any change to the settings, the router would reset itself for between 15-90 seconds.  That seemed like a big of overkill.Lastly, the guest network feature would work, but the connection under that separate SSID name was hideously slow.  If the regular one was connecting at or close to the 20.0 mb/s that we get for speed, the guest network would connect at something like 0.25 mp/s.  That's unacceptable.In the end, I didn't want a router that I had to \"babysit\", and I always felt like that's what I was doing with this.  So I got the Apple Airport Exteme.

Especially switching back and fourth screens to switch from letter to numbers and other characters. This Keyboard Case had good and bad Amazon reviews. I took a chance and bought one. It works really well.  Keys are understandably smaller than a Standard Keyboard size, but functional. Can a good Typist smoothly type on this? Probably, but it is more for Hunt and Peck Typists like myself who seldom have both hands crowding the keyboard at the same time. Pros: Full Keyboard with individual Cut/Copy/and Paste buttons. And CD/DVD Play/Pause/FF/RR/Vol up/Vol down/Mute/Screen Brighter/Screen Dimmer/Home/and Search keys. Useful stuff. It has a left and a right Shift keys, BUT the right shift key is the same size as a standard letter key. That angered some reviewers. Me, I could care less cause I don't use that one anyhow.  It also has a DELETE key. BUT, it does not act like a Delete key. It does the exact same thing as the BACKSPACE key. Why they even included it if it wouldn't correctly Delete, is just wrongheaded. The complaints about the charging plugs for the keyboard and Ipad NOT fitting into their charging sockets when the case is closed doesn't apply to this model, because they DO both easily plug in when the case is closed. Trent must have modified the cutouts in the case to accommodate the plugs, because this no longer is an issue.  The Ipad instantly sleeps when the lid is closed so, no more shutting it off or turning it on. The Keyboard sleeps when not used for several minutes, and takes one or two key taps to awaken it again. On a single overnight charge, the keyboard lasts about 10-16 hours of heavy use, so, you need'nt charge it EVERY night for average daily couple hour keyboard usage.  I charge mine once every 4 or 5 days. A small green CHARGE light starts to flash, when it thinks it needs charging soon. Trent put this large CONNECT button on the top of the keyboard, as if it gets used often, but I only initially had to use it for it to find the Ipad. Haven't used it since. There is also a ON/Off switch, but I never use it, since the keyboard sleeps when not being used, and it uses very little juice while sleeping. There is even a Caps Lock LED at the top of the keyboard. It comes with a Key covering membrane sheet to protect the keys from coffee spills. It is removable, and easy to lose, so I don't use it.  I use a Stylus for Internet Browsing. The great thing about this case, is when you get ready to close it up, the track that the Ipad rested in, can now be used to store your stylus. The gap is wide enough to easily remove the stylus when ready.  The Keyboard Has up/down/left/right Arrow keys, but they don't scroll pages. But one thing they CAN do, unlike the Ipad keyboard, is simplify cursor movement left and right in a typed email or Document to correct spelling or typo errors. YAY. That alone is worth the price for this keyboard.  I highly recommend you put a screen protector film on your Ipad, and ditch the Keyboard membrane. It also supposedly protects the screen from the hard plastic keys when the case is closed, but a Screen Protector will do that, and no Membrane to lose. I also highly recommend you passcode protect the Ipad if you carry the case around a lot, here's why: When the case is closed and the Ipad if sleeping, and the keyboard is sleeping, if you squeeze the case, it presses down on the keyboard keys, which wakes up the Ipad and the Keyboard. The Keyboard gets bored after several minutes of no use, and goes back to sleep. But if the Ipad is not Passcode protected, it will remain on, and use battery juice. If it IS passcode protected, it will pop up a Passcode screen, and if you don't respond in 60 seconds, it goes back to sleep.  This is a really nice looking case. It has Leather-like accents. May be Leather, may not. Looks good. I get many compliments on this case. The Ipad part removes easily, for playing games, or reading ibooks. All Ipad Control buttons and camera are not obstructed by the case. I also recommend that if you are planning to use this case on a lap sitting in a chair, or in bed, get a lap table. One of those table like things with a Lap pad on the bottom, so the case has a flat, stable surface to rest on. Otherwise the Ipad will tip out of its Track in the keyboard case. There are 3 adjustable positions for Ipad tilt, to reduce overhead lighting glare.  For the price, this is a pretty good Product. It won't make your Ipad replace a Laptop Computer, but it outshines that dopey Touchscreen Keyboard that Apple forced us to use. And it is much cheaper, and better looking than the Keyboard case Apple sells.  Another thing I did, was buy the Yellow High-Glow Enlarged Keyboard Number/Letter stickers (from Amazon).  I had to trim every one down to fit, since they are for Standard sized Keys. But, in a very dark room I can now easily see the keys to type just from the glow of the Ipad screen at 3/4 Ipad brightness. Bigger, bolder letters and numbers.**** UPDATE 1 year later:  ****  This keyboard is starting to suck bigtime.  It double-strokes letters too often. And, too often, the letter keys I press while typing, do not register.  For some reason the Ipad spell check/correct does not work with this keyboard, so as I am typing along, I look back to see all the typing errors.  I am spending way too much time correcting, undetected typing errors.  Another thing,...when the keyboard was new, it was instantly recognized by the iPad. Nothing to initiate.  NOW, I have to go to settings in iPad, at startup, and manually connect the keyboard every time.  Also, the battery life of the keyboard after a full charge, is about 2 hours, before typing errors get really bad.There is no remaining charge time for the keyboard, so it's a crap shoot as to how much time is left, after standing by for any length of time.  I will be buying a better keyboard."}], "B00511PS3C": [{"review_id": "41987945d9e5742787db5edbec3515ad", "review": "So, got this last night and was extremely glad it and the cable I purchased enabled me to use my phone GPS.

We only used them when on long trips.  Recently I wanted to start using them for shorter trips making the bulky laptop device inconvenient.  I purchased the Garmin because it has very good ratings and is very portable.  I also like the elevation option and how easily it can be selected.So on my first drive I enjoyed the map, the warnings and clear turn announcements.  It also gives a clear indication of upcoming interchanges and what lane you need to be in to get off on the correct ramp.  This the laptop software was not so great at.  It has so far tested very very well at navigation.  That is what we buy them for isn't it?  I also tested it for being able to track my movements, and it was right on.  The Speed indication is a pleasant surprise and it tells you in a moment that you are breaking the speed law.  It also gives a warning when you are approaching a Red Light Camera intersection.Things to be aware of are the maps are not completely up to date, but then most are not.  We have a couple Red Light Camera intersections in town that have existed for well over a year or two now and the Garmin did not know the cams are watching the traffic at a couple of them.  ALSO be sure to know where you are going and the route because they seem to ignore the ROUTE NUMBER and call some highways by a ROAD NAME, which I did not recognize.  In my area, the ROUTE NUMBER is used as the name, NOBODY KNOWS the road name and it isn't posted.  This is a major highway that GARMIN chose to call by a street name that I have never heard of.  To take this further, I was traveling south and the same problem with the ROUTE NUMBER being ignored came up.  I found some street names I was very unfamiliar with.Also, I drove by a couple of streets which used to be drive through but have been adapted to \"no exit\" or \"DEAD END\" roads for traffic control..This adaptation occurred years ago but the map does not indicate this.  I am not saying the Garmin unit is bad, AS a matter of fact, I really like it now that I know what to watch for.  But the map supplier seems lacking in some small cases.  I strongly suggest being aware of where you are going and possibly carry a map in case the Garmin gets you into something that it can't show a reality map for.One VERY HELPFUL THING  was when trying to program a favorite place.  ONE location I needed to save was very rurual so the map only shows a main road and not much else.  Find the approximate location where you want to find an address, tap the \"PLUS\" on the screen.  As as the map magnifies, it will start to show more roads .  Once your road comes up, tap along the road for the addresses.  It will only display one address at a time and you will be hunting for your address. If the address does not show, hit the PLUS and try again. Just keep tapping until the address you need comes up.  You may need to move up or down the road to find your address, when you do, save as your favorite.  This Garmin is new to me so this was unexpected as the screen shows nothing but a main road when the map is first accessed in rurual areas.  Keep in mind that if the road is not on the screen, tap the plus to get closer and it will appear.  Then tap for the address locations. I was really glad this function is available.  It will be really useful.My over all experience is good and I really like the portability and ease of programming favorites and such.  Get it and enjoy it but be aware of it's qwerks and you'll have a good travel adventure."}], "B005CPGHAA": [{"review_id": "befe0210b12e0fe29bdbdc8f6167f317", "review": "this mouse is pretty good i ordered it for a good price it shipped fast and got it in a few daysa few things about this mouse is1. the blue led lights in it stay on no matter what  i have it plugged into the back of my pc2. the dpi switch is 400/800/1600 i have mine on 8003. the scroll wheel you can feel the bumps in it but there soft bumps not hard clicks4. it came in its own box but all the papers in it were in chinese not english"}], "B005PZ07PI": [{"review_id": "0dc88376d2068656701228c24582fb80", "review": "Lots of decent, well-reviewed cases are out there for the Acer Iconia A100.  This one was slightly cheaper (I paid $18.95) and still had free Super Saver Shipping when I bought a micro SD card at the same time.Case fits well, and makes all the difference as far as holding the tablet. Without a case, the tablet is somewhat \"slick\", feeling like it is easier to let slip from the hands. The case fixes all that (as I imagine most cases would). The crease that allows the front flap to fold is in the perfect spot for the thumb to nestle into when gripping.All cutouts were good, especially the one for the camera and LED in back (stylish, shaped cut-out, yet plenty of room for the camera lens). At first I thought the basic fold/insert way of holding the tablet in would not be enough, but it is. The tablet feels very secure and snug once the internal flap is folded around the tablet -- the friction works well.The case closes by using four magnets, two of which are embedded in the part of the case close to the tablet. I had heard that some case magnets interfere with GPS/compass operations. This was not the case for me. For compass apps that only use magnetism, I think this may be true true, at least to some extent, but for full-on GPS, the magnets and case do not appear to cause any issues. I fired up GPS Status after not having used GPS for several weeks, and satellites started becoming visible almost immediately. With A-GPS assistance, I had between 7 and 11 locked in under a minute (I was outside under a clear sky but still in Wi-Fi range from my house). So, GPS and wireless definitely work fine and I have not noticed any degradation since putting the tablet in this case.So, why only 4 stars? Well, the stand functionality leaves a little to be desired. First of all, the plastic slot in back where the leather flap is meant to insert (to create the stand) is very inflexible. So, it is hard to get the flap inserted, and the leather has to deform a bit to get in there. I have not seen any blemishes on the case, but I imagine that over time the flap might warp a bit, and/or if the leather smooths it might pop out of the slot. Also, trying to stand up such a small tablet (7-inch) is a bit wobbly in this case, but that is mostly due to the nature of the folds being so close together and the leather still being fairly rigid.Overall, though, a great case for the price. I like the stylish white stitching, and the case is well-built.

I first scanned for channels with my current antenna attached. I then disconnected my antenna and immediately attached the Winegard FlatWave. I oriented it in the same direction used for my current antenna, which is toward the closest major city (about 30 miles away). I also placed the FlatWave as high as possible in the room. I then re-scanned for channels.Results: My original antenna picked up 31 channels. The Winegard FlatWave picked up 12. The difference is that the Winegard antenna picked up only stations from the direction the antenna was pointed, while my current antenna also picks up stations from 3 nearby cities in other directions.Discussion: My current antenna is a DB4 multi-directional type and much larger than the FlatWave. Considering the size of the FlatWave, it performs very well. Depending on the direction the FlatWave is pointed, you will pick up any nearby stations within your area, but just not at the same time.Conclusion: The Winegard antenna does what it says it will do. It picks up stations within the distance specified (actually a little further) and along the orientation direction. However, my current antenna is multi-directional and picks up stations that are twice as far and in various  directions. It is not surprising that it performs better, but I was very impressed by the FlatWave."}], "B0068MSGZA": [{"review_id": "805788358a4cbee2015c6c48c89dcb88", "review": "Great case!

That would be the quality and flexibility of the video, the quality of the optical image stabilization, and the overall quality of the still pictures it takes.  I didn't care about the GPS as it is largely a gimmick in my opinion and all the major competitors have it now or they feel they won't be able to compete.You should realize that the GPS built into this camera (and most cameras) is NOT the same GPS you may be used to in your car or smart phone.  It does not have detailed maps, does not have a large database of places or landmarks, and is not as accurate.  It is basically for tagging your photos and videos with the latitude and longitude of where you took the image so you don't have to take notes manually to sort out what you shot and where later.  That's why I consider it largely a gimmick.Briefly then, this camera had by far, the best video quality and flexibility.  You can select AVCHD video in several quality levels including full HD at 1920 x 1080 @ 60 fps (if your computer can handle it--many can't), MP4 video in several quality settings including full HD 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps, and even a (not too useful) 320 x 240 setting for high-speed video at 240 fps.FOR TECHIES ONLY: Note that most of these video settings output progressive video but one of them outputs interlaced (can't remember which AVCHD setting).  This makes me suspicious that the internal video circuitry may be interlaced and not progressive and they simply convert (deinterlace) the video when they create the progressive video file on the memory card.  I could not find confirmation on this anywhere and calling Panasonic support is utterly useless for something this technical--they just aren't trained to know such things.  I must say though that I didn't notice any interlaced artifacts or sharpness/quality issues with the video so I'm satisfied with the video either way.The optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing and was so far superior to the Nikon for example, that I had to keep checking that I actually had the image stabilization in the Nikon turned on!  You can literally hand-hold the camera at full 20x zoom (being very deliberate and careful) and shoot acceptable video, which is almost unheard of in a small camera like this.The still images are very high quality and have relatively low noise for a camera that has this many pixels in the sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that it's mostly the marketing departments that want to keep pushing the number of pixels in these small cameras.  The engineers know that when you put this many pixels on a small sensor, you get more noise artifacts and you can do only so much about that.  This camera is no different in that regard than all the others that are 14 or higher megapixels, regardless of what they claim in their marketing hype.And the final selling point over some of the competitors for me was that this camera, even with all its consumer \"presets\" to make this a \"point-and-shoot\" camera (actually almost too many--confusing!) still has FULL MANUAL CONTROLS and aperture or shutter priority settings for \"real\" photographers.Note that like most other pocket cameras, this one does not support RAW files but that's not what it is intended for.  Furthermore, with single images files as large as almost 13 MB in size from the 14.1 megapixel sensor, you have more than enough pixels to do some serious Photoshop work even without having RAW files to work with.This will now be my \"take everywhere\" camera when I don't need to do \"serious\" photography and don't want to lug around my full sized Canon DSLR and lenses."}], "B0079M711S": [{"review_id": "1a5bf38fdea058a5a9c03dafec7a9d3b", "review": "Good Flash at a great price.I use two off camera with and w/o umbrellas or softbox.

For me, the pros did not outweigh the cons with this one.It easily doubles the weight of the iPad (generations 2 and 3 are sized and weigh the same), making it cumbersome to handle and carry. I can see why people and their kids are dropping it with this thing on, and the solid heavy weight and bulk it created made it more prone to being knocked around in my bag. In fact, it barely fit into my bag with this thing on. I mean, it's thicker than my MacBook! This is because the shield (that doubles as a stand) juts out about half an inch to keep the stand inside from resting against your screen when you have it on to travel.  In terms of weight and size, I would say it's the difference between lugging around a heavy hardback book (and trying to stuff that in my bag) instead of having just a slim trade size paperback (as with a folio case).The other thing I disliked about the shield/stand thing was that I found it difficult and noisy to remove and set up.  You've got to pry the shield off corner by corner by either bracing the iPad against something or pulling the shield in one direction and pushing the iPad in another.  I was having to do it all the time, (which just made it more likely that I'd drop it) and there was also always this obnoxious creaking/clicking sound as i did it.  That sort of thing bothers me because---okay this will probably piss off some of the over zealous reviewers but, I wouldnt want to draw any more attention than the case already does on it's own, as it is embarrassingly overprotective and makes your iPad seem like some mysterious giant tablet or you know, like some kind of fisher price tablet... .i mean, i know some reviewers are saying that people often admire their otter cases and ask about them...but I think it's more like they're admiring your giant Fire and thinking wow, the Fire really IS like the iPad!  Maybe I should get one...  Maybe it loosens up after a while, but the design is so solid that this seems unlikely. It won't bother you if you only use the shield as a stand or to travel, but the screen protector is just a clear sheet of plastic like any other screen protector so I guess I just prefer to have the sort of cover that I can just close over the iPad like a book cover when i carry it around casually.All that aside, the case is still nice and the fit is PERFECT, but I think it's overkill unless you actually need this sort of protection---like if you have little kids that will be using it, or you use it in a job where it'll be abused on a daily basis--otherwise there are plenty of cases out there that fit just as nice but are more convenient (not to mention better looking).

The kit Lens that came with my camera is completely silent, and I have yet to hear any camera noise picked up hen shooting video, even in quiet, indoor shoots. I bought this lens for the same purpose, as well as shooting photos, as it is a great focal length for video, and the low aperture is great for low-light photos. Here are my conclusions:For Photos: This lens is incredible. The pictures are razor sharp, and when you shoot with the aperture wide open, the bokeh effect you can achieve is really cool and makes for some beautiful, intriguing photos. The autofocus is quick and responsive, allowing you to quickly frame and shoot. The only downside to this lens is since there is no Image Stabilization, you have to be very steady when shooting hand-held, especially if you get below 1/100th shutter. Adjusting the settings, you can usually find a clear shot, it just may take some toying. On a tripod, you have nothing to worry about, obviously. This was definitely a good purchase for photos.For Videos: The quality of video produced by this lens is great. It lets in some serious light with the f/2.8 aperture, so you can do some good low-light shoots. The focal length is ideal for most video applications, but the lack of zoom does make for some walking around to frame the shot properly. The downside with this lens when compared to the STM 18-55mm is that the autofocus motor makes some noise. I was used to complete silence with STM lenses, and this one, although quiet, can still be picked up, especially when shooting with the internal mic. It's nothing compared to a non-stm lens, which are much louder, but it is audible and can be picked up in quiet shoots. Not a huge deal, but it is worth noting, if this lens is being purchased with that function in mind. If you are using any kind of external micing, you should be fine.Pros:Crisp, good color, fast autofocus, solid construction, light-weight, small form factorCons:Autofocus a little noisy"}, {"review_id": "e5eb791dbae960bef8c71c7257ed4499", "review": "This is a very nice addition to the Canon EF line-up.

The kind you don't have to argue about. It's there in quantity for any need you might have. That aside, I see this SRMT as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the SRMT using bass reduction, since I listen to music only, and my tastes are mostly towards neutral reproduction.The SRMT sounds to me like a blend of two other headphones I have - the Marshall Monitor and the Beats Mixr. The SRMT's bass is extra strong like the Mixr, and when bass reduction is used, still has a stronger bass (including the deep bass) than most so-called high fidelity headphones. The rest of the range above the upper bass sounds more like the Marshall - darker than the Mixr, especially in the &#34;presence&#34; region or lower treble. Most other reviews I've read of the SRMT don't describe the sound very precisely, comparing to other known references like the Mixr, or even the old school headphones like the Sennheiser and Beyer models. I have a feeling that any critical reviews of the SRMT by the best-known establishment reviewers will find the combination of extra strong bass and some shyness in the lower treble - that will take points off of their ratings for this headphone.In my case, using bass reduction for critical listening at home, the balance is perfect, or as near perfect as anything else I have, and that's excellent. The sound overall has a darker tonality than the average headphone, including the Beats Mixr, and it's about the same as the Marshall Monitor. The reasons I believe the SRMT is a 2-headphones-in-1 bargain is because 1) The SRMT's sound using bass reduction is excellent, with no bothersome peaks or dips anywhere in the music frequency spectrum; 2) The sound played flat (no EQ) provides the extra bass that gets lost in many portable use situations - outdoors or on public transport for example; and 3) Where most &#34;bassy&#34; headphones don't have the extra strength in the deep bass that they have in the upper bass, and using bass reduction with those headphones results in a weak lower bass, the SRMT's lower bass remains solid with good impact. The only other headphones I recall having this good of a bass response are the v-moda M100 and the Beats Mixr.The overall sound of the SRMT is very smooth from top to bottom. Unlike some reviewers who go into minute detail about the many aspects of sound the customer is likely to experience with their new headphone, I stick to the things I can explain - the things that anyone can hear on their music player, computer, or portable headphone amp etc. Besides having a bass response that's solid and detailed (given the things I noted above), and a midrange that's just right (neither forward nor recessed), the SRMT's treble is also ideal - just strong enough with enough detail for reproducing the fine upper harmonic detail in voices and instruments, but not so strong as to make sibilants or other treble irritations from lower-quality music tracks bothersome. I rarely say anything about amps except that they improve the sense of space or &#34;air&#34;, but with the SRMT and my USB DAC/amps, the highs dried up more than when playing with the iPod alone, and I got better results with the FiiO E07k through the 'Aux' port.The SRMT's soundstage seems at least average, which is good for a closed-back headphone. Isolation also seems average for a closed headphone, and the leakage is low - low enough that playing the SRMT at a moderate volume level in a cubicle next to other cubicles in a quiet office should not be a problem. The music track examples listed below will tell my impressions of the SRMT's sound with that particular music. If you should happen to read other reviews on the SRMT that describe either the mids or treble as recessed, consider that those reviewers are playing the SRMT with the bass full up and that I'm using bass reduction. The reason I'm not reviewing the sound of the SRMT played flat (no EQ) is because many other reviewers have already done that, and I want to provide an alternative for customers who'd like to have a headphone like the SRMT, but wouldn't like extra-strong bass.The SRMT comes in several colors, and my video review shows the plain black version I purchased. The SRMT seems to be mostly plastic, including the headband I think, but the headbands are user-replaceable and are easily found at retail stores. I consider the build quality to be as good as the sound - excellent. The earcups are circumaural (around-ear), and they fit around my average or larger size ears with great comfort. There are 2 main classes of circumaural earcups in my experience - the large round cups like the Beyerdynamic DT770 and other Beyer series, or the Soundmagic HP100 and HP200, to name some examples. Then there are the smaller oval earcups/earpads like the Sennheiser Momentum, the Phiaton MS400, the v-moda M100, and the SRMT. The SRMT fits me better with greater comfort than any of these other small oval earcup/earpad designs.The headband clamp is fairly light for this type of headphone, and it's also very secure on the head, but the snug and secure fit may have a price - in very warm weather the earcups may feel overly warm. The 4-ft. straight cable is detachable and double-side entry, and the 2.5mm plug that goes into each earcup looks like a stereo plug, although the extra connector may have something to do with the start/stop and volume controls. The other end for the computer or music player is an Apple-style right-angle miniplug. The SRMT doesn't come with any sort of carry case, just a thin plastic-coated bag that won't protect the headphone from anything. If you need to take this headphone with you to various places and you don't want to wear it around your neck (that works very well BTW), I'd advise taking it apart - earcups and headband and cable - and packing them into whatever protective container you can find.In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the SRMT compares with each individual track. I copied these examples from my Beats Mixr review and then went through each one in a listening session, checking for any differences I heard from what I reported for the Mixr, and found only one or two minor differences - an excellent result. The SRMT is now one of my 4 favorite headphones, which includes the Beats Mixr, the Marshall Monitor, and the v-moda M100.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth should have good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals should sound natural, without favoring either. The SRMT plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off should sound realistic, and the sax should sound soft. The SRMT plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced, and there should be a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRMT reproduces the space and detail very well.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice sounds good and the tambourine in the background is clearly identifiable.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the ambient electronic effects should maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or &#34;ringy&#34; sound as some headphones might produce if they have uncorrected resonances. The SRMT does this one just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The SRMT handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced. The SRMT makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the SRMT handles this perfectly. The trumpet should sound natural but soft, and the voice should have the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The SRMT does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the SRMT handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the SRMT reproduces those deep notes even with bass reduction enabled as described above.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the SRMT gets it right. The percussion and female voice should balance well with neither overwriting the other, and the SRMT aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the SRMT. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The SRMT balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track should sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices should have a good balance and not overpower the music or sound recessed. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices should blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The SRMT renders the percussion treble correctly (not too bright, not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The SRMT renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRMT reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality, and the SRMT plays these notes very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRMT renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRMT delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string(?) tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the SRMT. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the SRMT headphone."}], "B00CTUIT20": [{"review_id": "1ded9cffdffc06580c65a4e9c833b9ff", "review": "It is actually sometimes difficult to find a 10' usb to micro usb cord in my local stores, and those that are available are usually $20 and up in cost.

With my N900 the 5Ghz took a drastic toll going through a thin inside wall!Very easy to set up and secure everything and very fast."}, {"review_id": "571da6d236ea6ba80dc747c1f06a112f", "review": "UPDATE: 5/17/14 - PORN is stronger than the NETGEAR Nighthawk!I don't usually put my updates at the beginning of a review, but after writing such a stellar one only days before I felt it important to 'share' to warn off others.After setting up Parental Controls to 'custom' and checking off 'downloads, adult, nudity, and porn', I expected my home network would be porn-free, as it was with theBelkin N750 Wireless DB Dual-Band Gigabit N+ Router With High Speed HD Streaming & USB (F9K1103); which while slower - it's also a quarter of the price I paid for this one. Needless to say last night I learned that porn is stronger than the Nighthawk.Parental Control Problems:1. If you set the router on the highest setting for network protection it filters porn, however it also filters out pretty much anything but first grade friendly material. A no-go for a house with a teenager who has reports to do for school and needs internet access.2. In the Parental Control interface you can setup strict browsing for the family and an override account for those who don't need or want it, but using 'custom' settings is frustrating and seems to be hit and miss for porn specifically.3. In the Parental Control settings you can add up to 25 sites you want blocked. That's it - and it's not enough for all trash on the internet!4. In the Genie dashboard under Advanced - Security you can add keywords and domains (yuck dot com, dot net...) to block. When those are set, if a user attempts to go there they get a black screen with red stripes that says 'Firewall Blocked' user.5. Removing a 'keyword' is a joke too! You have to clear the list and start over, as it won't let you delete just one word like 'porn' to eliminate all sites with that keyword in the title from opening.You can set things up so that the administrator gets emailed every time one of the blocked sites gets a 'knock, knock' by a user on your network. Unfortunately, this too has a limited number of sites and/or keywords that can be added, and it's just not enough for the price you pay for this router!The speed and stability is great, but I hate that with this expensive piece of equipment and user-interface that seems to be so helpful - these limitations are put on the device.I didn't buy this router to limit porn, but it is one of the things I like to do on my home network. I'm not a prude, but I should be able to surf securely if that's part of what's promised at a premium price.Oh, and the way I found this out was that I periodically go onto a browser like Bing or Google and type in random words and phrases to see what shows up. When it's something related to porn and I know I have the filter set, I click to make sure they are blocked. Last night, it wasn't and I spent nearly 3 hours learning the limitations of the NETGEAR Genie software.Maybe this is something that can be addressed by the NETGEAR Team in an update? It will definitely have to be improved upon to be considered a safe router for households who are concerned with Parental Controls,  and I would not recommend this router for this reason.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a huge, pricey wireless router which is worth every penny if you're living in a big home, have multiple devices all wanting WiFi, want to be able to take command of your network in darn near every way possible or 'all of the above'.WHY I CHOSE THIS WIRELESS ROUTER...I purchased this router with some trepidation due to the high sticker price. It's twice as expensive as the most expensive one I've previously purchased and also twice as big.  Despite these things, I was looking for a router to replace myBelkin N750 Wireless DB Dual-Band Gigabit N+ Router With High Speed HD Streaming & USB (F9K1103), which while OK, was struggling to keep up with the growing WiFi demands of my family.With 15 wireless devices used on the network (laptops, desktops, streaming devices, smartphones, gaming systems, etc...), if everyone was connected, we all experienced signal drop offs. When streaming video it was not uncommon to get lagging connections and/or encounter buffering issues.After reading a bit about higher end routers, I decided to get a simultaneous dual band router. This one works well as you can set the (QoS - Quality of Service) to uploads (for gaming) or to downloads (for streaming). These two things opened up a whole new level of enjoyment in this cord cutter household!Having written a book on cord cutting:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, and using myRoku 3 Streaming Media Player,Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media PlayerandApple TV MD199LL/Ato supplement my over air HD TV network programming, I know the importance of a solid WiFi network and this NETGEAR Nighthawk beautifully gets the job done. Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus all load more quickly and offer great picture quality and stability.In addition to this router's awesome performance and range, this NETGEAR product has a fantastic software utility suite (for both PC and MAC) with free iOS and Android apps. The software is easy to use and highly customizable.  I love the Parental Controls, which can be set for the whole network, or just for specific devices.THE PROS:+ Exceptional range.+ Outstanding speed (*more than doubled my download speed from 33Mbps to 68Mbps) with simultaneous dual band (2.5Ghz and 5Ghz).+ Excellent security settings, which are setup for you at installation. **NOT true - see update!***+ Whisper quiet.+ Lights can be turned OFF in NETGEAR Genie (Settings - Advanced - LED Control Settings) or have them blink, or remain solid - your choice!+ QoS settings make customizing your network a breeze for the things you do most whether they are gaming or streaming; by group or per device.+ Can set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to access your network from anywhere.+ Lots of options for tweaking the setup, if you desire it.+ READYSHARE for printers or for network storage and back-up is a great feature.+ Guest network setup is optional.+ At a glance access to all the devices on your network by app or PC with NETGEAR Genie software.+Setup Wizard in 'Advanced' area of NETGEAR Genie works to effortlessly get you online.+ You can set up FTP storage.+ DLNA enabled for media server functionality; including iTunes library.+ USB 3.0 port for connecting external storage or media server.+ Ability to block specific sites or sites by keyword, in addition to Parental Control settings which are highly customizable.+ Ability to block services on a schedule.+ Ability to have WiFi turn off during scheduled times during the day or by entire days of the week.+ Ability to set up email alerts when devices on the network attempt to connect to specific sites.+ Ability to enable wireless repeater function.+ Ability to see traffic loads (upload/download) on your network.+ The router can be hung on a wall or sit on a desktop.+ Very cool to the touch, with excellent ventilation on the sides of the device.+ You can set password recovery questions when you reset your password from the default 'password' at start up.THE CONS:- It's HUGE, and the 'wingspan' with the three antennas attached makes it about the same footprint as a 15\" laptop. (I have mine hanging on the wall with the cables coming out the top for easy access.)- Initial setup even with NETGEAR Genie did not go smoothly for me, and I'm an intermediate to advanced user. Small tweaks here and there in the NETGEAR Genie got all of my devices to play well together eventually though.- The price is hefty compared to other wireless routers for home use, but its features and speed are impressive.THINGS TO NOTE...Firmware updates must be made out of the box; Advanced - Administration - Router Updates and then 'Apply'. (You can get the latest prior to setting up your router and install it by finding the file on your computer, or let the router connect and obtain it.)There's an iOS app called 'Net Analyzer Lite' that I found to be very useful in identifying some of my devices by MAC address. This in addition to the NETGEAR Genie app are both free, and well worth the downloads.This is an impressive package both in terms of hardware and software. I'm very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend it to those who want a feature-packed router with top notch speed and security settings. I think it would be ideal for a small business, multi-level or large home, or any sized home with lots of devices (10+) who are all competing for bandwidth.Highly recommend this one if you can afford it!UPDATE: 5/11/14 - I'm loving this router! Netflix flies through shows using 5Ghz and no buffering with a Roku 3. I can download an album to the Amazon Cloud in about 15 seconds and every web browser: Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari... loads pages faster. I'll be hooking up a Seagate USB 3.0 external drive with movies to use the DLNA feature and will update this review after that use.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this purchase.UPDATE: 5/17/14 - That 'love' was short lived and the 5 star rating was dropped to a '2' star based upon porn getting through and the limited ability to add blocked sites or keywords for added security. Paying this much for a router - it should have solid security as well as speed."}], "B00HNFPZF0": [{"review_id": "32f0933ca22a2553af02d4b5e3c8de32", "review": "I have had this item for less than a week and am still becoming more familiar with it. Having said that, my initial impressions are very positive and are as follows:Pros1. The case is very beautiful, stylish, rugged and well designed. It is lightweight and adds little bulk to the device. It fits my iPad Air like a glove and all ports are accessible. In addition, all ports have covers which helps protect them from damage, dust, etc.2. The specs say that the case is shock proof and water resistant. Although I had no chance to verify this personally,  the fit seems tight and it would be difficult for water or dust to penetrate the case.3. The built in screen protector works very well. I removed the original screen protector from the iPad and then applied the built in screen protector. This did make it easier to install the iPad Air in the case and there were no bubbles or grids, as some people experienced,  on the screen. In addition, the touch screen feature of the iPad was very responsive and performed as if the screen protector were not there.4. With the case on, I found that the power, the home and the volume buttons were very responsive to light touch. There was no need to exert substantial pressure to get them to function properly.5. In my opinion, the star of the show is the leather hand strap on this case. It is very stylish, elegant, gives added protection from accidental drops of the device, and makes holding the device very comfortable.  It is adjustable to fit most hand sizes and rotatable to various angles for easy and comfortable viewing of the device. This feature reduces the fatigue of holding the device for long periods. Makes me wonder how did I live without this feature before.6.  The kickstand is made of metal and is very sturdy. It has a bottle opener on it.  It is a good feature to have, but not necessary for my purposes.Cons:None that I would consider a deal breaker.Conclusion:All in all, this is an excellent case for the iPad Air. I rated it a 5/5."}]}
